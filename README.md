The "NYC Uber Ridesharing Data" and the "Público, crítica y taquilla en IMDb" Streamlit apps where awesome sources of inspiration for its structuration.

The simple co-ocurrence network analysis is based on Gin04kg's notebook.

The estimation of a Random Forest models for, respectively, oil prices and renewable energy consumption, considering sentiment analysis is based on Bee Guan Teo's notebook.
