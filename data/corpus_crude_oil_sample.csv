Oil Bulls Rejoice As Biden's Supply Strategy Backfires,2021-11-24T18:00:00-06:00,"President Bidenrsquos threat to oil producers that he would force prices down has already backfired. Oil markets were unimpressed by the U.S. administrationrsquos plan to coordinate a strategic petroleum reserve release from major importers in an effort to increase supply. While some observers believe an SPR release could push oil prices down, most analysts have warned that it will only have a temporary effect and could eventually trigger a price spike. OPEC members have not even engaged with Bidenrsquos strategy as they saw it as flawed from the start. The release of 50 million barrels of crude from the US SPR was never going to significantly impact oil prices. U.S. analysts are now worried that Bidenrsquos actions could end up with higher oil prices.nbsp  Bidenrsquos plan first garnered support from other OECD countries, such as Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom, before it was rumored that China and India would also release oil from their reserves. To really push a market down, however, a clear and potentially price-threatening oversupply would have to be on the horizon. At present, there is no such threat, with OPEC reporting a potential but small oversupply in 2022. The total commitment of all SPR releases under Bidenrsquos plan was expected to be around 100 million barrels, which is roughly one day of global production. Realistically, that release would take place over several weeks, making for an additional daily volume of 4-5 million bpd. Given how unimpressed markets were with Bidenrsquos initial release, it is starting to look like this strategy will end up being bullish for oil markets in the long term. Bidenrsquos plan appears to have taken market fundamentals into account but failed to understand the real impact and production capabilities of OPEC at present. While Saudi Arabia and the UAE hold some spare production capacity, other OPEC producers and non-OPEC members are struggling to even produce their agreed-upon volumes. It remains unclear what OPECrsquos reaction to Washingtonrsquos strategy will be, but rumors have already begun to circulate. It is possible that Saudi Arabian, UAE, and Russian oil strategists will decide not to increase production volumes or they may simply stick to the plan for the coming months. The impact of the SPR release already appears to be waning, with oil prices already trending upwards again. At the same time, despite new covid cases across Europe, the overall demand for crude oil is still expected to increase. The ongoing energy crunch in Europe and China will only add to the demand for crude oil. Russiarsquos unwillingness or lack of capacity to deliver gas to Europe and possibly China will do the rest. Winter is coming, temperatures are going down, even earlier than expected, so another gas storage volume hit is already underway.nbsp    The desire to quell global oil and gasoline prices is only growing in the U.S. and China, but OPEC is not to blame. One of the main drivers at present for higher gasoline and consumer prices is the quantitative easing QE policies being used to reduce the global damage from covid. If Western and Asian leaders really want to do something about crude oil prices, they should remove QE and cheap money from markets. A lack of cash or financial reserves will push down demand for crude oil within weeks or several months. Blaming OPEC for high prices is like blaming Santa Claus for price inflation of consumer goods during the Christmas Season. Santa is not increasing prices, it is the demand of consumers. Governments have added trillions of dollars to the market for infrastructure projects, energy-transition GIGA projects, or real estate booms. Cash availability is driving the market for crude oil. Economic growth needs energy, it is a simple fact of life. Biden and his advisors should first and foremost look at their own domestic markets and crude oil and gas producers. By restricting domestic producers and supporting large-scale hydrocarbon exports while importing Russian, Saudi, and other crudes, Biden is failing to address the core issues behind high gasoline prices. OPEC and other oil producers are not behind the current bullish market sentiment, it has been caused by QE, a lack of investment, and ineffective policies.nbsp  It will be very interesting to see what OPEC leaders decide when they meet in Vienna. The remarks of OPEC leader Barkindo, Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, and the UAErsquos minister Al Mazrouei are unlikely to be diplomatic. They believe they are being blamed for something that Biden and others are responsible for. In the mid- and long-term, Bidenrsquos decision will almost certainly backfire. The SPR release could provide temporary relief to oil markets, but that oil will have to be replenished at some point - and most probably at a higher cost which governments will pass on to consumers and industry.nbsp  By Cyril Widdershoven for Oilprice.com",-1,-0.9926,"['oil', 'prices', 'OPEC', 'Bidenrsquos', 'release', 'crude', 'markets', 'producers', 'plan', 'SPR', 'market']"
"OPEC To Add 400,000 Bpd In January Despite Oil Price Plunge",2021-12-02T08:53:55-06:00,"The OPEC group is sticking to its plan to ease the production cuts in January by 400,000 barrels per day, despite mounting evidence of a larger-than-expected oil surplus early next year.  At the meeting of the alliance on Thursday, the ministers have decided to keep the policy to add 400,000 bpd to the market each month, as they have been doing since August.  All ministers of the OPEC group appear to be in agreement with increasing output by another 400,000 bpd next monthshymdashthat is, rolling over the current supply addition policy, Amena Bakr, Deputy Bureau Chief amp Chief Opec Correspondent at Energy Intelligence, reported, citing sources. nbsp  There will also be an extension of the compensation cuts, the sources added.  Before the full OPEC ministerial meeting, the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee JMMC held a meeting, which ended with the panel not issuing any recommendation for OPEC production in January.  Shortly before the JMMC meeting began, reports had it that the OPEC group could discuss adding just 200,000 bpd in January instead of 400,000 bpd, or even a pause in the ramp-up of production, sources told Reuters.  Going into the meeting, OPEC was said to be expecting a worse-than-previously expected surplus in the first quarter of 2022.  Some analysts expected the alliance to indeed pause the cuts, considering the expected oversupply, a potential impact of the Omicron variant, and the SPR releases from several nations led by the United States.  Earlier this week, Saudi Arabia and Russia had already signaled that the new variantmdashstill very little researchedmdashshouldnrsquot be a reason to jump to hasty decisions.  Russia currently doesnrsquot see the need for urgent measures, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said on Monday.  ldquoWe donrsquot see such a need, we will carefully monitor the situation, but there is no need to rush to hasty decisions,rdquo Novak, Russiarsquos chief oil policy negotiator at OPEC, said.  So OPEC stayed the course and is raising its total production quota by 400,000 bpd in January. The new quotas per country, as reported by Energy Intelligencersquos Bakr, include Saudi Arabia and Russia producing up to 10.122 million bpd each in January, with a total OPEC quota of 40.494 million bpd as follows    By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com",0,0.4497,"[' ', 'OPEC', 'bpd', 'January', '400,000', 'meeting', 'production', 'expected', 'group', 'cuts', 'policy']"
UAE Pumps $6 Billion Into Oil And Gas Expansion Projects,2021-11-24T17:00:00-06:00,"The U.S.-sponsored lsquorelationship normalisationrsquo deal signed last year between Israel and the UAE is a core element of Washingtonrsquos attempt to counterbalance the advance of China and Russia across the Middle East. The key corporate proxy of the UAE at the forefront of this is the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co ADNOC, and the announcement last week from the firm that it will invest up to US$6 billion towards improving its drilling business is in line with this overall aim. It is also vital in enabling the UAE to achieve the corollary targets of increasing its crude oil production to 5 million barrels per day bpd by 2030 and of achieving self-sufficiency in gas as soon as possible. The broader aims of the U.S.-Israel-UAE alliance were also evidenced by the defence deal signed last week between the UAErsquos defence conglomerate, Edge, and Israel Aerospace Industries IAI.  The specifics of the investment, as announced by ADNOC, include US$3.27 billion for wellheads and related components, US$2.34 billion for down-hole completion equipment and services, and US$337 million for liner hangers and cementing accessories. In line with the UAErsquos position as a key U.S. ally in the region going forward, U.S. companies featured heavily in the contract awards, most notably including Baker Hughes whose UAE agent, Al Gaith Oilfield Supplies amp Services Company, was part of the US$3.27 billion award, and also of the US337 million deal, and Schlumberger Middle East, which won a major share of the US$2.34 billion contract. As part of ADNOCrsquos lsquoin-country value programrsquo around 60 percent of the total value of the US$6 billion awards could flow back into the UAErsquos economy, according to a statement from the company.  These announcements follow on from a flurry of similarly-themed activities announced and undertaken by the company since the announcement of the UAErsquos relationship normalisation deal with Israel was announced on 13 August 2020. These have variously been aimed at one of three principal aims expanding the UAErsquos regional economic power, increasing its role as a key hub for energy trading, and countering Iranian threats to oil supplies through the Strait of Hormuz.nbsp The first of these developments is lsquoOperation 300 Billionrsquo, which intends to raise the contribution of the UAErsquos industrial sector to AED300 billion US$81 billion from the current AED133 billion within the next 10 years. At the centre of these plans, which in turn fall within the UAErsquos Circular Economy Policy 2021-2031, will be an adjunct build-out of the UAErsquos energy sector. This includes the increase in crude oil production from 4 million bpd to at least 5 million bpd by 2030. Much of this increase will be geared towards India as the prime end-user in the East that is being cultivated by the U.S. to become a more active regional rival to neighbouring China.nbsp    This dovetails into a second key initiative, which is to make the UAE a key regional energy trading hub. In this context, ADNOC launched a dedicated Murban futures contract on a new Abu Dhabi-based exchange ndash the ICE Futures Abu Dhabi platform IFAD - in partnership with the Intercontinental Exchange ICE. The light, sweet Murban crude oil grade is one of the four crudes produced by ADNOC, although it accounted for around half of the UAErsquos total near-4 million bpd crude oil production before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to ICE and ADNOC, Murban futures is the second physically delivered futures contracts traded on a regional exchange after Dubai Mercantile Exchangersquos Oman crude futures, and Murban is also a deliverable grade in the Platts benchmark Dubai and Oman crude assessments. ICE and ADNOC initially partnered with BP, GS Caltex, Inpex, ENEOS, PetroChina, PTT, Shell, Total and Vitol to launch the IFAD, and ICE has also announced agreements with Chevron, Trafigura, and Occidental to explore using the contract to price crude exports from the U.S. to Asia.  This new trading hub neatly ties into the third major initiative ndash countering Iranian threats to oil supplies through the Strait of Hormuz ndash which is being addressed by ongoing plans to dramatically expand the capacity and facilities of the major port in the UAErsquos Fujairah emirate over the next 10 years. Fujairah offers an unencumbered direct access point to the Gulf of Oman ndash but on the eastern side of Oman itself ndash which means that any oil kept there be able to avoid any blockade that Iran might again impose on ships passing through the Strait of Hormuz. This option became increasingly attractive to Iran after it finalised its Guriyeh-Jask oil pipeline that allows its oil to flow without going through the Strait even as it blockades 30 per cent of the rest of the worldrsquos oil supply. As it stands, Fujairah is the key hub from which the UAErsquos Murban oil is exported, making its way there through the 360 kilometre Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline from the Habshan onshore field in Abu Dhabi and capable of transporting 1.8 million bpd. ADNOC is also currently developing underground oil storage caverns in Fujairah that can hold 42 million barrels, including Murban, with the project expected to be completed in 2022.nbspnbsp  It would be naiumlve of anyone to think that any substantive deal engineered by the U.S. and Israel in the Middle East would not include a significant element of co-operation on intelligence and military matters and this deal is no different. As analysed in depth in my new book on the global oil markets, a key part of this joint intelligence initiative has been the dramatic increase in the past two years of commercial property in Iranrsquos southern Khuzestan province ndash a key sector for oil and gas reserves ndash being purchased by UAE-registered businesses, particularly those based in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. These apparently Abu Dhabi and Dubai businesses are supported by funds from a major Israeli company that in turn is funded from an Israel-U.S. operation specifically set up for this project, with a budget of US$2.19 billion in the first instance, OilPrice.com understands from sources with knowledge of the matter. Essentially, Israel aims to achieve through the UAE presence in southern Iran what Iran has done through its presence in Lebanon and Syria.nbsp  A more overtly tangible sign of such co-operation was in evidence last week with the announcement that the UAErsquos Edge defence conglomerate and Israelrsquos IAI have signed a strategic agreement to jointly design unmanned vessels capable of carrying out anti-submarine warfare. According to a statement from the two companies, the lsquo170 Mrsquo advanced modular unmanned service vessels that they will design and produce will be usable for both military and commercial purposes. ldquoThese developments will open many doors for us in local and global markets, military and commercial alike,rdquo Faisal Al Bannai, chief executive officer of Edge said in the statement. ldquo[The new product] will also be usable for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, mine detection and sweeping, and as a deployment platform for certain types of aircraft,rdquo the company added. This not only follows of all the developments mentioned above but also the agreement made just after the August 2020 relationship normalisation deal that the U.S. will provide the UAE with the latest F-35 fighter planes.nbsp  By Simon Watkins for Oilprice.com",1,0.9875,"['oil', 'UAErsquos', 'billion', 'UAE', 'US$', 'key', 'million', 'deal', 'Abu', 'Dhabi', 'ADNOC']"
China Keeps Markets In The Dark About SPR Release,2021-11-24T16:00:00-06:00,"The volume of the expected Chinese release of crude oil from its state reserves will be decided according to the country's actual needs, China said on Wednesday, declining to comment if it would be releasing crude in the coordinated effort led by the United States. nbsp  The Chinese side will organise a release of crude oil from state reserves according to its own actual needs, China's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a daily press conference on Wednesday, cited by Reuters.  China, the world's largest oil importer, is in communication with both oil-producing and oil-consuming nations, the spokesman added. Yet he declined to comment on the U.S. push for major oil consumersmdashincluding Chinamdashto release crude from their reserves in an attempt to lower oil and gasoline prices. nbsp  At the end of last week, China was alreadynbsppreparing to release crudenbspoil from its strategic reserve, Reuters reported, citing the country's National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration.  We are carrying out the work of releasing crude oil reserves. And for any details related to the releasing, we will put out a statement on our website, a spokeswoman for the Chinese administration told Reuters.  On Tuesday, US President Joe Bidennbspannounced that the Department of Energy would release 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve SPR in a bid to lower high gasoline prices in a coordinated effort with other major oil-consuming nations.  [T]his release will be taken in parallel with other major energy consuming nations including China, India, Japan, Republic of Korea and the United Kingdom, the White House said on Tuesday.  Despite the announcement of the coordinated release, oil prices rallied after the U.S. said it would release crude from strategic reserves.  The oil market has largely priced in SPR releases, as last week's slide in prices showed, analysts say, also pointing out that one-off sales from strategic reserves cannot do much to move oil prices significantly lower.nbsp  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com",-1,-0.9552,"['oil', ' ', 'release', 'crude', 'reserves', 'China', 'prices', 'said', 'Chinese', 'releasing', 'coordinated']"
Oil Markets Unimpressed By Small Crude Inventory Build,2021-11-24T09:36:00-06:00,"Crude oil inventories rose last week, while gasoline inventories declined, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.  The EIA has reported that crude oil inventories increased by 1 million barrels for the week to November 19.  At 434 million barrels, the authority said, crude oil inventories were still 7 percent below the five-year average for this time of year.  The reported draw compares with a draw of 2.1 million barrels for the previous week and analyst expectations of a 481,000-barrel draw.nbsp  For gasoline, the EIA reported an inventory decline of 600,000 barrels for the week ending November 19, which compared with a draw of 700,000 barrels for the previous week.  Gasoline production averaged 10.1 million bpd last weekmdashan increase from the 9.9 million bpd produced in the prior week.  In middle distillates, the EIA data showed an inventory draw of 2.0 million barrels for the seven days to November 19, with production averaging 4.8 million bpd.  This compared with a stock draw of 800,000 barrels for the previous week and average daily production of 4.8 million barrels.  Refineries processed 15.6 million bpd last week, and imports of crude stood at 6.2 million bpd. This compared to refinery runs of 15.4 million bpd and imports of 6.2 million bpd for the previous week.  The announced release of 50 million barrels from the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserves to bring down gasoline prices has had little effect on the price of crude oil so far. The barrels will not be releasedmdashin the form of an exchangemdashuntil next month.  At 900 a.m., prior to the EIArsquos data release, WTI crude was trading at $78.43, down just $0.07 -0.09% on the day. Brent crude was trading at $82.23, down $0.08 -0.10% on the day.

SPR Release Only Triggered A Brief Selloff In Crude Oil,2021-11-23T12:00:00-06:00,"Media reports about the joint release of millions of barrels of oil by the United States, China, and Japan prompted a selloff across oil futures contracts and a decline in benchmarks over the last week. However, the trend reversed this week when OPEC suggested that it might tighten supply in response to the release.  The reserve release idea came from the White House, which has been scrambling to find a way to rein in retail fuel prices amid rising inflation. According to the reports, President Biden approached the governments of China, India, Japan, and South Korea with the suggestion they release oil from their strategic reserves jointly in a signal to OPEC that large consumers can also move prices, just like large producers.  Initially, the prospects of the concerted release of oil were dim, but then China announced it was preparing for a new oil tender that would offer crude from its strategic reserve. Then Japan said it had found a way to release crude from its strategic reserve legally.  The country had an issue with the legality of such a move as law states oil from the strategic reserve could only be released in times of shortage or in case of a natural disaster, neither of which applies now. However, according to a Bloomberg report from earlier today, a draw from the reserve was legal if it was made from surplus supply.  Initially, India was against the move, saying it would not have the desired effect, but according to the latest update on the topic from Bloomberg, which cited unnamed sources, the government in New Delhi was discussing the timing of the reserve release and the coordination with other large consumers.  The U.S. itself announced a release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve today. And it was a substantial release at 50 million barrels released over several months, according to a White House press release.  Even ldquoa 35-million barrel release from the U.S. would be significant,rdquo according to Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING Groep. ldquoOnce you consider potential volumes from others, we are looking at something pretty substantial. The risk of further Covid related restrictions this winter and potential SPR releases might be enough to persuade OPEC to pause supply increases.rdquo    While large oil consumers confronted OPEC with reserve releases, hedge funds went on a selling spree, according to Reutersrsquo John Kemp. Funds sold 34 million barrels of West Texas Intermediate and 18 million barrels of Brent crude last week, out of a total 57 million barrels sold across the six most traded crude and oil product contracts.  As a result of this selloff, oil prices have been on the decline lately, especially as concern about demand in some parts of the world such as Europe has been rekindled by the latest flare-ups of Covid infections even in countries with a high vaccination rate such as Denmark. This, in turn, has added weight to OPECrsquos argument about the uncertainty of demand in the coming months and the suggestion that it might need to reconsider its decision to add 400,000 bpd to its combined monthly production. This, done in response to the collective reserve release of crude, will likely push oil prices even higher despite the demand concerns.  ldquoThe battle lines are being drawn,rdquo said John Kilduff, founding partner at Again Capital, as quoted by Bloomberg.nbsp ldquoCertainly, OPEC and the Saudis can win this in that they are holding all the cards. They can keep more oil off the market than a SPR release can put on the market. If you see WTI get under $70, then I would expect a response from OPEC.rdquo  By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com",-1,-0.9859,"['release', 'oil', ' ', 'reserve', 'barrels', 'OPEC', 'crude', 'according', 'million', 'prices', 'strategic']"
Biden Administration Considers Ban On U.S. Oil Exports,2021-11-23T10:00:00-06:00,"A potential ban on crude oil exports is under consideration at the White House, a Democratic Congressman told Bloomberg, adding that ldquoThe economics of it makes sense.rdquo  Rep. Ro Khanna, chair of the environmental sub-panel of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, disagrees with analysts who have been warning that a ban on U.S. oil exports could backfire, ending up in higher prices at the pump.  ldquoLimiting U.S. crude to the domestic market means fewer potential buyers, and less demand, for that crude,rdquo wrote Kyle Isakower, senior VP of the American Council for Capital Formation, for The Hill in a succinct explanation of the backfiring.  ldquoThat would likely be followed by a corresponding drop in American production. Since crude oil is traded globally, reduced U.S. production mdash regardless of where it is ultimately refined into fuels ndash lowers the global crude supply. Less supply on global markets putsnbspupwardnbsppressure on price mdash not downward. Therefore, banning crude exports is more likely to raise prices than to lower them.rdquo  In other words, a ban on U.S. oil exports would only push prices higher. Of course, proponents of the idea would argue that the ban will not be the only measure to bring prices down. The White House announced today a release of crude oil from the strategic petroleum reserve in the amount of 50 million barrels over the course of a few months, according to an unnamed source quoted by Bloomberg.  However, Khanna and several other Democratic lawmakers are certain that a ban on oil exports would have the desired effect. A group of nine House Democrats yesterday wrote a letter to the White House urging the president to ban oil exports and release oil from the SPR.  To warnings that a ban on oil exports would hurt the U.S. oil industry and trap oil that refineries cannot process on its own, Khanna said that refineries could be reconfigured.

Biden Announces 50 Million Barrels SPR Release To Lower Oil Prices,2021-11-23T07:45:00-06:00,"US President Joe Biden announced on Tuesday that the Department of Energy would release 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve SPR in a bid to lower high gasoline prices in a coordinated effort with other major oil-consuming nations.  The U.S. Department of Energy will make available releases of 50 million barrels from the SPR, of which 32 million barrels will be in the form of an exchange over the next several months, releasing oil that must be returned to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the years ahead. Another 18 million barrels will be an acceleration into the next several months of a sale of oil that Congress had previously authorized, the White House said on Tuesday.  The SPR release from the United States is being carried out in parallel with other major energy-consuming nations, including China, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom.  ldquoThe President stands ready to take additional action, if needed, and is prepared to use his full authorities working in coordination with the rest of the world to maintain adequate supply as we exit the pandemic,rdquo the White House said.  ldquoAmerican consumers are feeling the impact of elevated gas prices at the pump and in their home heating bills, and American businesses are, too, because oil supply has not kept up with demand as the global economy emerges from the pandemic,rdquo the U.S. Administration said.  Other major consumersmdashincluding India, China, and Japanmdashhave already signaled they would also release crude from their reserves.  Yet, analysts expect the coordinated move to have only a temporary effect on international crude oil prices and say the market has likely already priced in the SPR releases.  At the same time, the OPEC group warned on Monday that it could respond to a coordinated release by potentially reconsidering plans to continue adding more production each month to meet demand.  OPEC is set to meet next week to decide the oil production policy for January. The coordinated pushback against the OPEC policies could prompt the group to lower or even pause its monthly addition of 400,000 bpd of oil production, ING strategists Warren Patterson and Wenyu Yao said on Tuesday.  ldquoThe prospect of retaliation from OPEC does leave the potential for further volatility in oil markets,rdquo they added. nbspnbspnbspnbsp  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com",0,0.1779,"[' ', 'oil', 'release', 'million', 'barrels', 'SPR', 'coordinated', 'said', 'OPEC', 'Tuesday', 'prices']"
U.S. Shale Is Refusing To Reinvest Despite Record High Cash Flow,2021-11-22T17:00:00-06:00,"Reinvestment rates among US shale oil producers hit an all-time low in the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a record free cash flow for the quarter, and are projected to fall even lower by year-end according to a Rystad Energy analysis. The analysis focused on a peer group of 21 public US shale oil producers, excluding majors, that together account for 40% of the expected 2021 output.  The peer grouprsquos combined reinvestment rate in the third quarter of 2021 was 46%, down from 53% over the same period in 2020 and way lower than the historical average of above 130%. The reinvestment rate is calculated by comparing shale producersrsquo oil and gas capex against their cash flow from operations CFO. The CFO of the last quarter was the strongest since the second quarter of 2019.  The analysis shows $7 billion in underspending by shale producers over the third quarter of 2021, comparing oil and gas capex with CFO. Operators managed to slightly increase peer-group quarterly capex in this yearrsquos third quarter to $5.9 billion, up from $5.3 billion in the previous quarter, while further increasing CFO to $12.8 billion. All but one operator balanced spending in the third quarter of this year, reaching a new level of industry-wide cash balancing.  ldquoSuch a low reinvestment rate stands out for shale industry observers, especially as the peer group reported a record-breaking free cash flow FCF and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization EBITDA of $6 billion and $16 billion, respectively. But itrsquos not the end of the reinvestment slide,rdquo says Alisa Lukash, vice president for North American shale at Rystad Energy.    Rystad Energy projections show that reinvestment will fall further to 40% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Also, for the first time since late 2018, the grouprsquos combined net debt dropped below the eight-year average floor of $52 billion, coming in at $51 billion for the third quarter. Additionally, leverage ratios continued their consistent decline in keeping with the past three quarters.  Third-quarter results show several large independent operators ramped up spending in line with another financially robust quarter, in part due to the strong recovery in West Texas Intermediate WTI crude prices. Operators, as expected, started to communicate 7% to 15% cost inflation, with much of the impact anticipated to come in early 2022. However, this is expected to be absorbed by improved well productivity and capital efficiencies in most cases.    Combined third-quarter net income for the peer group amounted to $5.3 billion, double the income earned in the second quarter of 2021 and significantly higher than the sizable losses of $6 billion and $2.1 billion in the third and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively. EBITDA, meanwhile, recovered to $16.3 billion in this yearrsquos third quarter, a level not seen historically. FCF across the peer group was $5.6 billion, a rise of $500 million from the previous quarter and more than double the $2.5 billion seen in last yearrsquos final quarter.  Dividend payments jumped by 70% for the peer group in this yearrsquos third quarter versus the second quarter. In comparison, the actual dividend-to-capex ratio increased to 26% compared to 17% in the preceding quarter. Further capital spending control by the industry was aimed at deleveraging and garnering stable shareholder support. Stock buybacks have predominantly been paused as the market recovered naturally with the WTI price increase. However, a few companies CLR, FANG, PDCE initiated buybacks amounting to $200 million.  For the first time since late 2018, the peer group dropped combined net debt below the eight-year average floor of $52 billion, reporting $51 billion for this yearrsquos third quarter. Many operators mentioned revised hedging plans for 2022 due to lower expected leverage. Both leverage ratios ndash total debt to assets and total debt to equity ndash have consistently declined during the last three quarters. Despite more robust stock prices driving total equity up in 2021, the decline in leverage ratios has been partly offset by consistent debt issuance flared by merger and acquisition opportunities in the shale sector.

India May Join Coordinated Strategic Oil Reserves Release,2021-11-22T10:00:00-06:00,"India is ready to join the global efforts of major oil consumers led by the United States to reduce oil prices.  The world's third-largest oil importer, India, plans to release crude oil from its strategic petroleum reserves in a coordinated effort of consuming nations to bring down prices, three government sources told Reuters on Monday. nbsp  The United States has asked the top Asian consumers India, Japan, China, and South Korea to release crude from their respective strategic stockpiles after the OPEC group has been ignoring for months calls from consumersmdashmost vocal from the U.S.mdashto increase the monthly production by more than the 400,000 bpd decided in July.  At the end of last week, China was already preparing to release crude oil from its strategic reserve, Reuters reported, citing the country's National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration.  We are carrying out the work of releasing crude oil reserves. And for any details related to the releasing, we will put out a statement on our website, a spokeswoman for the Chinese administration told Reuters.  Japan is also considering a release from its crude reserves, together with the United States and other major consumers, to reduce prices, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Saturday, as quoted by Kyodo News agency.  If Japan goes ahead with such a release, it would be the first time the country has tapped into its oil reserves to reduce prices. Japan has previously released crude from reserves, but only in times of supply shortages, such as during the Gulf War in 1991 or in the wake of the Fukushima disaster when it closed all its nuclear plants. Currently, Japan's Oil Stockpiling Law allows for reserve releases only in such cases, nor for lowering oil prices. Officials, however, say that stockpiles that exceed Japan's reserve targets could be released without revising the law, Kyodo News notes.  Market talk of a coordinated reserves release has dampened sentiment and dragged oil prices lower in recent days, although Goldman Sachs, for example, says that the market has already priced in such a global effort.

"Big Oil Is Finally Exercising Restraint, And Biden Is Pissed",2021-11-20T16:00:00-06:00,"This week, the Najahrsquos Desert Oasis gas station in southeastern California put up a sign of the times. It read $6.39 for regular. This remote gas pump isnrsquot your average fuelling station, to be sure, and even at the best of times, it has the highest gas prices in the country. But breaking the $6 mark is a monumental occasion, even for Najahrsquos. In California as a whole, the average gas prices are a painful and record-breaking $4.68 per gallon, and the nationwide average for a gallon of regular gasoline is now $3.41 -- a whopping $1.29 more than just a year ago. Indeed, inflation rates across the country are at a 31-year high, and Americans are really feeling the squeeze, and many are casting about who to blame for the hardship.  Although global demand for electricity has bounced back to pre-pandemic levels, global oil production has not -- not by a long shot. In the United States, oil production remains 12% lower than in February 2020, right before the impact of the pandemic ripped through oil markets. Thatrsquos the equivalent of pulling the U.S.rsquos entire production in the Gulf of Mexico out of the global economy. And oil and gas production levels have remained low even as the world suffers from an extreme energy crunch and skyrocketing fuel prices.nbsp  And whose fault is it Depending on who you ask, the answer is either Vladmir Putin and a geopolitical power play on the part of Russia, Joe Biden and his dastardly plan to do away with fossil fuels and suck U.S. coffers dry in the process, or OPEC and their stingy refusal to respond to the energy crisis unfolding in Europe, Asia, and to a lesser extent the United States. Now, President Joe Biden is pointing the finger at another culprit the conniving and greedy domestic oil and gas industry. This week the U.S. president asked federal regulators to open an investigation into the U.S. oil and gas industry to determine whether companies are engaging in illegal conduct by profiting off of consumersrsquo pain, citing mounting evidence of anti-consumer behavior by oil and gas companies.  The bottom line is this gasoline prices at the pump remain high, even though oil and gas companies' costs are declining, President Biden wrote this week in a letter to FTC chair Lina Khan. The Federal Trade Commission has authority to consider whether illegal conduct is costing families at the pump. I believe you should do so immediately.nbsp  Indeed, the price of unfinished gasoline has declined more than 5% over the last month. Typically this decline would be reflected in prices at the pump, but instead, gas station sticker shock continues to intensify across the U.S. This unexplained large gap between the price of unfinished gasoline and the average price of the pump is well-above the pre-pandemic average, Biden continued, adding that Big Oil is raking in significant profits off higher energy prices.  Backing up President Bidenrsquos claims, Bloomberg released a report this week that oil and gas explorers in the United States may point to politics as the reason that they are holding back on upping production to ease oil prices, but the real reason is much simpler they are making money hand over fist. According to figures from Deloitte LLP, U.S. oil companies are making more money now than at any other point in the entire history of the nationrsquos shale revolution. ldquoAnd this may just be the beginning,rdquo Bloomberg Markets wrote. ldquoFree cash flow, the key metric watched by investors, probably will increase by 38% next year, presuming oil prices remain elevated.rdquo  The American Petroleum Institute has fired back at President Biden in the wake of his plea to the FTC, saying that the move is merely a ldquodistraction from the fundamental shift that is taking place and the ill-advised government decisions that are exacerbating this challenging situation. A representative of API went on to criticize Bidenrsquos allocation of his time and energy to fight with the domestic oil and gas industry and OPEC, saying that his attentions would be better spent ldquoencouraging the safe and responsible development of American-made oil and natural gas.

Biden Asks The World For Help Easing The Global Energy Crisis,2021-11-21T18:00:00-06:00,"Oil prices have dipped to their lowest levels in six weeks, with both Brent and WTI dropping below the psychologically important $80 per barrel mark for the first time in weeks. Brent was quoted at $79.67/barrel in Friday's intraday session, with WTI trading at $77.65 as talk of several countries releasing crude from their strategic reserves continued to gain momentum.  According to Reuters, the Biden administration has reached out to several countries, including China, India, South Korea, and Japan, urging them to synchronize the release of crude from their Strategic Petroleum Reserves SPRs in a bid to lower global energy prices.  On the opposite side of the spectrum, European gas prices have recovered from their intra-week lows as indications of Russian supply flows remained disappointingly low.nbsp  According to the Financial Times, whereas Gazprom OTCPKOGZPY started adding some gas to its largest storage sites in Germany and Austria last weekend, Russia has failed to book additional pipeline capacity, suggesting that any storage fill would come from existing flows.  Russia has done what it said it was going to do, but in a very narrow way. What would get a bigger reaction from the market would be if Gazprom went back to auctioning short-term gas supplies, as they have done in previous years, Laurent Ruseckas at IHS Markit tells FT.nbsp  Front-month UK National Balancing Point NBP gas rose by 1.89 pence p per therm w/w to USD 204.79p/therm on 15 November, a strong rebound from the settlement of 178.98p/therm on 10 November. Dutch Title Transfer Facility TTF gas rose by EUR 0.873 per megawatt hour MWh, before surging above EUR 89/Mwh on 16 November in the wake of the temporary suspension of the regulatory approval process for the Nordstream 2 pipeline.nbsp  Also worth noting The price of EUA carbon allowances has been bolstered by the COP26 meeting, and in particular by the completion of the Paris Agreement's carbon trading framework. The front-month EUA contract rose by EUR 5.30/t w/w to an all-time high of EUR 65.93/t on 15 November.  While gas prices remain strong in other regions, US prices have continued to fall thanks to a relatively comfortable inventory position due to a warmer-than-usual start to the winter and, of course, the latest SPR developments.nbsp  According to the American Gas Association AGA, there were 96 heating degree days in the week to 13 November, 28 fewer than normal i.e., warmer conditions than normal. The cumulative number of degree days since the start of October stands at 421, 134 fewer than normal and 27 fewer y/y.  Front-month Henry Hub gas prices declined USD 0.41 per million British thermal units mmBtu w/w to USD 5.017/mmBtu.  Coordinated SPR release  Biden's highly unusual move comes just months after he made another unusual request to OPEC to boost production so as to tame the oil price rally. Predictably, OPEC declined the offer and has stuck to its earlier routine to boost output by 400,000 bpd a month that it started in August until the rest of the 5.8 million bpd cut is phased out.  However, Biden's SPR move is a different gambit altogether because, unlike OPEC, which is clearly interested in maintaining high oil and gas prices, China and India have already begun releasing crude from their SPR's with a similar end-game to Biden's Lower oil prices.nbsp  China does not disclose the volumes of crude flowing into its strategic and commercial stockpiles. However, it's possible to work out an estimate by deducting the total amount of crude available from imports and domestic output from the amount of crude processed.  Related Brits Google lsquoEnergy Bill Helprsquo As Energy Suppliers Go BankruptCalculations based on this method reveal that China drew 589,000 bpd from its SPR in May 980,000 bpd in June, and 223,700 barrels per day in July. HFI Research estimates that China's SPR capacity sits at between 840 to 1,260 million bbl, with current reserve levels closer to the lower end of that range.  Meanwhile, crude imports for the first eight months of 2021 clocked in at 10.4 million bpd, down 5.7% from the same period last year.  Back in June, Beijing announced huge cutbacks in import quotas for the country's private oil refiners. According to Reuters, China's independent refiners were awarded a combined 35.24 million tons in crude oil import quotas in the second batch of quotas this year, a 35% reduction from 53.88 million tons for a similar tranche a year ago.  The story is pretty much the same in India.  India announced in August that its SPR will be more active, although its relatively small size compared to China's makes its impact more muted.  India has started selling oil from its SPR to state-run refiners as part of efforts to commercialize the storage. Reuters reported 5.5 million barrels are in the process of being sold, while Indian newspaper Mint reported on Sept. 12 that a total of 4.3 million barrels would be sold to two refiners by December.  These are relatively low volumes, representing little more than one's day demand for India.  Done on an independent basis, SPR releases from either the U.S., China, or India might not do much to unsettle the global oil markets. A coordinated release by 4 or 5 of the biggest SPRs is, however,nbsp a different story.  Immediate Relief  President Biden has faced calls for action from various parts of the Democratic Party,  including the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who on 14 November demanded immediate relief at the gas pump. U.S. gas prices have surged 60% since the beginning of the year, with prices in California hitting all-time highs.  Related Our Renewable Future Will Run On CopperHowever, the key advisors in the White House currently appear to be split along the lines of their main area of expertise.  The economic and political advisors to the president who are generally in favor of early action against gasoline prices point to falling presidential approval ratings and worrying inflation readings. Energy advisors to the president who are generally more willing to wait point to the gasoline price forecasts in the Energy Information Administration's EIA's Short Term Energy Outlook the EIA expects gasoline to average USD 3.16 per gallon gal in December, down from the current national average of $3.41per gallon, and between USD 2.99-3.02/gal in each of the first six months of 2022.  According to Standard Chartered analysts, the best result for the administration would be that the market stays in the current holding pattern for an extended period. A sharp oil price rally above USD 85/bbl would likely force a release of reserves, but the more that time goes by, the more we expect fundamentals to become more comfortable, and the less credible the calls for a rapid rally well beyond USD 100/bbl are likely to become.  The analysts say that calls for a release have led to a situation whereby a significant amount of money is on the side-lines of the market looking to buy the dips after any actual release. While many traders doubt the credibility or the effectiveness of an SPR release, few would wish to be caught in an exposed long position at the time a release happened, and keeping that money out of the market has taken the momentum out of the price rally. The threat of a release has already gained the US administration at least two weeks of extra time.nbsp  Losing some credibility among oil traders by not releasing quickly seems a relatively minor cost in terms of the time gained and the underlying weakening of market fundamentals and the associated dispersal of the market-tightness fear factor.

EIA Sees Brent Oil Price Falling To Average $72 In 2022,2021-11-18T12:00:00-06:00,"Crude oil prices are set to decline next year from the current levels of around $80 a barrel as global inventories will start to build again with supply rising more than demand, the U.S. Energy Information Administration EIA said on Thursday.  Brent Crude prices are set to average $72 per barrel next year, due to the expected surplus on the market on the back of rising production from the United States and the OPEC group.  According to EIArsquos latest monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook STEO, global crude oil demand will exceed global supply through the end of this year, contribute to some additional inventory draws, and keep Brent Crude prices above $80 per barrel through December 2021. Global oil consumption exceeded crude oil production for five consecutive quarters, starting in the third quarter of 2020, the EIA said. Oil stocks in the OECD countries have fallen by 424 million barrels since then.  However, next year will see the beginning of stock builds, which will pressure prices downwards, the U.S. administration said.  Earlier this week, the International Energy Agency IEA said that early signs showed that OECD oil stocks had already started to build in October.  After hitting a six-year low in September, commercial oil stocks in OECD countries showed a marginal build in October, suggesting that the months of hefty inventory draws globally may be over, the IEA said on Tuesday in its closely watchednbspOil Market Reportnbspfor November.  OECD total industry stocks plunged by 51 million barrels in September, with crude oil and middle distillate accounting for most of the declines. Europe led the stock drawdowns in September when total OECD industry stocks stood at 2.762 billion barrels, which was 250 million barrels below the five-year average and the lowest level since the start of 2015, the IEA said.  However, preliminary data and satellite observations of stock changes in October point to a marginal stock build and suggest the tide might be turning, the agency said.  ldquoThe world oil market remains tight by all measures, but a reprieve from the price rally could be on the horizon,rdquo the IEA said this week.

China Prepares To Release Oil From Strategic Reserve,2021-11-18T09:00:00-06:00,"China is preparing to release crude oil from its strategic reserve, Reuters has reported, citing the country's National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration.  The news comes on the heels of reports that President Biden has asked China and other large consumers to do just that in an attempt to arrest the climb of oil prices.  However, Reuters notes that the Chinese National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration declined to comment on these reports, suggesting the move may have been planned before President Xi Jinping's virtual meeting with Joe Biden, which is when Biden first raised the issue.  We are carrying out the work of releasing crude oil reserves. And for any details related to the releasing, we will put out a statement on our website, a spokeswoman for the NFSRA told Reuters.  We will release more details on the volume of oil and date of its sale on our website in due time, just like we did in the first public auction,nbspthe spokeswoman told Bloomberg.  Earlier this week, Reuters reported, citing unnamed sources, that besides China, the Biden administration had also approached Japan, India, and South Korea with the suggestion they release crude oil from their strategic reserves.  The oil auction announced by the National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration would be the second one in September, the authorities auctioned 7.4 million barrels of crude for sale. The news did weigh on oil prices but only for a short while before prices rebounded again.  Then, earlier this month, Beijing also ordered the release of gasoline and diesel as the prices of fuels in some parts of China were rising too fast.

Chevron's Latest Oil Deal With Iraq Is One To Watch,2021-11-17T17:00:00-06:00,"The newly resuscitated Iraq National Oil Company INOC has been authorised by the government in Baghdad to directly negotiate with U.S. oil giant, Chevron, for it to develop the long-delayed Nasiriyah oil field in the southern DhiQar province, according to several domestic news sources.nbsp  The idea of developing the 4.36 billion-barrel Nasiriyah oilfield has been mooted by a rapid succession of governments in Iraq since it was discovered by INOC in 1975. The original plan to develop the field on a standalone basis was shelved in the lead-up to the Iran-Iraq war that began in 1980 and lasted until 1988. The field eventually came on-stream in 2009 and was listed on the 2009-2010 fast-track development plan, which aimed to raise its output to at least 50,000 bpd in the first phase.nbsp  In the first half of 2009, Chevron was one of four international oil companies IOCs, along with Italyrsquos ENI, Japanrsquos Nippon Oil, and Spainrsquos Repsol, to be invited to submit bids to develop the field on an engineering procurement construction EPC contract basis. The Japanese consortium led by Nippon Oil, and comprising Inpex, and JGC Corporation, then looked set to win the contract before negotiations broke down again.nbsp  In 2014, a serious push was made to resuscitate the development of the Nasiriyah field within the broader scope of the lsquoNasiriyah Integrated Projectrsquo NIP that also included the development of adjunct lesser oil sites to the main Nassiriyah site and the construction of a 300,000 barrels per day bpd refinery. Bids for this wider project were encouraged by the government-ordered changes to the original Iraq technical service contract TSC that were aimed at addressing the concern of many IOCs that saw the contract model as falling short of the production sharing contracts model that they preferred.nbsp    Unlike the previous contracts, the new TSC variant offered investors a share in project revenues, but only when production began, and the Oil Ministry would pay recovery costs from the date of commencement of work. This differed from the previous contract where the costs were only paid when the contractor raised production by 10 per cent. This said, investors would still have to pay 35 per cent taxes on the profit they made from the Nassiriya project, the same amount as in previous deals.nbsp  At that point in 2014, the international engineering and construction firm Foster Wheeler had already completed a front end engineering and design study for the refinery, and 12 potential bidders were on the list. These comprised Indiarsquos Reliance Industries, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, and Essar Oil, Russiarsquos Rosneft, Lukoil, and Zarubezhneft, Francersquos Total, and Maurel amp Prom, Chinarsquos CNPC, the U.S.rsquos Brown Energy, a Japanese joint bidding team from JGC and Tonen General, and South Korearsquos GS Engineering amp Construction.nbsp  Given longstanding IOC concerns about legal, accounting, and financial transparency in Iraq, this 2014 initiative to develop the Nassiriyah oil field foundered. As summarised by the independent international non-governmental organisation, Transparency International TI, in its lsquoCorruption Perceptions Indexrsquo, Iraq demonstrates ldquoMassive embezzlement,nbspprocurement scams, money laundering, oil smugglingnbspand widespread bureaucratic bribery that have led thenbspcountry to the bottom of international corruptionnbsprankings, fuelled political violence and hamperednbspeffective state building and service delivery.rdquonbsp  In 2017, China relaxed its directive of the previous two years to all state-owned hydrocarbons companies to cut budgets. From the Iraqi side, this coincided with a fresh impetus for expediting as much production from the south of the country ahead of the chaos in oil supplies from the north that was likely to result and did from Kurdistanrsquos independence referendum to be held in September.nbsp  These factors then led to Chinarsquos Sinopec and PetroChina proposing a deal that would see the NIP being rolled out as part of the broader lsquoIntegrated South Projectrsquo ISP. The ISP later rebranded as the lsquoSouth Iraq Integrated Projectrsquo aimed to boost output across Iraqrsquos southern oilfields, and also to build out related infrastructure, including pipelines, transport routes, and the construction of the Common Seawater Supply Project CSSP.nbsp  ldquoThe Chinese said that they would spend US$9 billion on the [NIP-related] refinery and the first phase of developing Nassiryah but as, under the terms of Iraqi oil contracts, the Iraqis would have to pay back this cost to the Chinese from the value of oil recovered,rdquo a source who works closely with Iraqrsquos Oil Ministry told OilPrice.com. ldquoThe initial reaction from the Oil Ministry was to decline the offer, and to say that the development should only cost around US$4 billion, which the Chinese in turn flatly turned down.rdquonbsp  The Chinese had other demands that grated on Iraq at that time as well. ldquoChina also wanted its firms to receive their costs back in a much shorter timeframe than most other similar projects,rdquo said the source. ldquoThis meant that they were effectively asking for a per barrel remuneration fee at a 15 per cent premium to the highest maximum fee being paid to any company in Iraq for a regular crude oil producing field, which was US$6 per barrel to PetroChina for al-Ahdab,rdquo he added. ldquoThis would mean that the Chinese would get around US$6.90 per barrel, more than [Angolarsquos] Sonangol for its heavy oil extraction at Najmah [US$6 per barrel] and Qairayah [US$5 per barrel] and would dwarf the US$1.49 per barrel that [Malaysiarsquos] Petronas was getting for the same type of field of Gharraf,rdquo he told OilPrice.com. ldquoChina also demanded that it was given [Iraq] dinar-denominated government-backed bonds for the entire amount [US$9 billion] that could be cashed in if the development did not start to generate large amounts of oil quickly,rdquo he underlined.  Given the negative history of dealing with China over the Nassiriyah project and the fact that Russia is occupied elsewhere in the country and the region, the U.S. might be in an unusually positive position to take a significant role in either the Nassiryah field development alone or in the broader NIP. This has been bolstered by the apparent willingness of Iraqrsquos de facto leader - radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr ndash to engage with U.S. ally, Saudi Arabia, and by the shift in tone from one key player in Iraqrsquos influential al-Hakim family.nbsp  Whether this shift in attitude towards doing substantial and enduring business with the U.S. across its oil, gas, and petrochemicals sectors is genuine, or whether it is just the usual games-playing by Baghdad to keep the money flowing from Washington, remains to be seen but the slew of deals signaled recently appear propitious at this stage.nbsp  By Simon Watkins for Oilprice.com",1,0.9324,"['oil', ' ', 'Iraq', 'field', 'Oil', 'US$', 'barrel', 'development', 'contract', 'Chinese', 'rdquo']"
Breakeven Price For New Oil Projects Drops In 2021,2021-11-17T12:00:00-06:00,"Rystad Energyrsquos annual cost of supply analysis has revealed that costs within the upstream sector have come down considerablynbspin 2021, making new oil more competitive and significantly cheaper to produce. The average breakeven price for new oil projects has dropped to around $47 per barrel ndash down around 8% over the past year and 40% since 2014, with offshore deepwater remaining one of the least expensive sources of new supply.  Our cost of supply curve for liquids indicates that back in 2014, an oil price of close to $100 per barrel was required to produce 100 million barrels per day bpd in 2030. By 2018, the required oil price was closer to $55 per barrel, and in 2020, it dropped to $45 per barrel. Our latest estimate remains unchanged this year at $45 per barrel for 100 million bpd of production in 2030.  We maintain the required oil price to produce 100 million bpd in 2030 unchanged, despite the declining average breakeven price of new oil projects, because the potential supply for 2030 has decreased since last year due to delays in sanctioning activity and conservative shale producers.  In 2014, we estimated that the total 2030 liquid potential was 104 million bpd, while in 2018, this jumped considerably to 135 million bpd mainly driven by increased potential volumes from North American tight oil. However, low activity levels in 2020 and 2021, due to the Covid-19 pandemic and a general focus on the energy transition, led to a downward adjustment in the overall liquid potential. In 2020, the potential 2030 supply was revised down to about 116 million bpd, and in 2021 we revised it further to about 113 million bpd.  ldquoAs the theoretical supply in 2030 exceeds the demand trajectory by more than 10 million bpd, climate policies should be more demand-focused rather than supply-focused. Supply cuts enacted within one country will largely be countered by supply increases from other countries, while demand cuts are not met with new sources of demand,rdquo says Espen Erlingsen, head of upstream research at Rystad Energy.    Breakeven prices by production source  From 2014 to 2018, tight oil and OPEC were the clear winners as both segments saw a reduction in the breakeven price and an increase in potential volumes. Back in 2014, Rystad Energy estimated the average breakeven price for tight oil to be $82 per barrel and the potential supply in 2025 to be 12 million bpd. Since then, the breakeven price has come down while the potential supply has increased. In 2018, we estimated an average breakeven price for tight oil of $47 per barrel and potential supply of 22 million bpd. The breakeven price for tight oil has continued to fall, reaching a current average of $37 per barrel. However, tight oil production potential in 2025 has dropped from our 2018 estimate to around 16 million bpd currently. This drop is due to the sharp reduction in activity during 2020. Lower activity last year, and a modest recovery this year removed potential tight oil supply from the market.    Between 2014 and 2018, offshore shelf and deepwater experienced a cost reduction of around 30%. However, the lack of new sanctioning activity over the period reduced the potential 2025 offshore liquid supply. Meanwhile, since 2018, breakeven prices for offshore deepwater fell by 30%, and for shallow water by 17%. These cost reductions put average breakeven prices for deepwater just below tight oil. At the same time, the potential 2025 offshore liquids supply has not changed much. This means offshore has had the most attractive development over the last three years.  Another segment with a positive development is oil sands. From 2014 to date, the average Brent breakeven price for new oil sands projects has declined from around $100 per barrel to around $55 per barrel. The main reason is that many future phases will be developed as smaller, incremental brownfield expansions rather than large-scale greenfield projects. In several cases, operators have not only indicated smaller expansions, but also plans to achieve cost savings by tying these into existing central processing facilities CPFs rather than building new CPFs ndash which might have happened several years ago when the pace of development was much quicker.  Onshore Middle East is the cheapest source of new production with an average breakeven price of around $32 per barrel. This is also the segment with one of the largest resource potentials. Offshore deepwater is the second cheapest source of new production, with an average breakeven price of $36 per barrel. Shelf remains the segment with the largest resource potential at 126 billion barrels of unsanctioned volumes. Russia onshore continues to be one of the more expensive resources due to the high gross taxes in the country.

Oil Inches Higher After EIA Reports Surprise Crude Draw,2021-11-17T09:40:00-06:00,"Crude oil prices gained today after the Energy Information Administration reported a crude oil inventory draw of 2.1 million barrels for the week to November 12.  At 433 million barrels, the authority said, crude oil inventories were 7 percent below the five-year average for this time of year.  The reported draw compared with an unexpected build of 1 million barrels for the previous week and analyst expectations of another build, of 1.55 million barrels.  In gasoline, the EIA reported an inventory decline of 700,000 barrels for the reporting period, which compared with a draw of 1.6 million barrels for the previous week.  Gasoline production averaged 9.9 million bpd last week, which compared with 10.1 million bpd for the prior week.  In middle distillates, the EIA estimated an inventory draw of 800,000 barrels for the seven days to November 12, with production averaging 4.8 million bpd.  This compared with a stock draw of 2.6 million barrels for the previous week and average daily production of 4.9 million barrels.  Refineries processed 15.4 million bpd last week and imports of crude stood at 6.2 million bpd. This compared to refinery runs of 15.4 million bpd and imports of 6.1 million bpd for the previous week.  Oil prices were trending lower at the time of writing, with Brent crude at $81.79 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate at $79.87 a barrel.  A forecast by the International Energy Agency that high oil prices would lead to a boost in production served to limit the upward potential of prices this week, even though concern about the adequacy of global supply remained.  At the same time, the IEA revised up its forecast for the average price of Brent for next year because of the supply concerns. Now, the authority expects the benchmark to average $79.40 per barrel in 2022.

U.S. Asks China To Release More Oil From Its Reserves,2021-11-17T09:00:00-06:00,"President Joe Biden has asked his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to release more crude oil from its reserves in concert with the U.S., in a bid to stabilize international oil prices.  Thatrsquos according to a South China Morning Post report citing an unnamed source familiar with the topics that Biden and Xi discussed during a virtual meeting this week.  China released gasoline and diesel from its reserves earlier this month to halt a price rise in some parts of the country that was beginning to make people nervous. Two months earlier, Beijing held its first-ever crude oil auction, at which it offered 7.4 million barrels of crude from the strategic national reserve. The news of the auction pushed prices lower, but the effect did not last.  In the United States, members of the Biden administration have mentioned the release of oil from the petroleum reserve as one possible move to arrest the climb of fuel prices. Democratic legislators have called for this, although experts warn that it will not have the desired effect.  ldquoOne of the pressing issues for both sides is energy supply,rdquonbspsaid the South China Morning Post source. ldquoCurrently, the energy departments from both sides are negotiating the details.rdquo  China, according to the source, is open to a concerted release of crude oil from the two national reserves but has not yet made a specific commitment, noting that it needed to first take care of local consumption needs.  The proposal appears to be yet another tool in President Bidenrsquos box for handling gas price troublemdasha box that has been often referred to by his administration but rarely in any detail. One other suggestion that a group of Democratic senators made earlier this month was to ban crude oil exports so there is more crude for the domestic market.  The idea did not win support from the oil industry.

Could An Energy Crunch Lead To A Worldwide Financial Crisis,2021-11-16T19:00:00-06:00,"There is a case that can be made that the present day liquidity profile and reduced capital investment in upstream sources for new supplies of petroleum, match the similar scenario of the 2008-9 financial crisis. In recent times, and partially as a result of the global pandemic, huge infusions of cash have been pumped into the market to achieve a number of objectives. Commodities began an extreme pricing upswing last year as a result of this cash infusion and pent-up demand from the shut-down phase of the pandemic. As a result, not only are there strong parallels to 2008, but current conditions are even more exaggerated as we approach 2022, thanks to continued governmental and financial intervention in the markets. In this article, we will examine some of the key causes of the 2008 financial meltdown, and compare them against relevant data in the present day. We will then tie that to current data on petroleum supplies and production to make our final case about the likelihood of a severe global financial crisis.  Lack of capital investment in upstream petroleum supplies  If you follow the news you will become quickly and acutely aware that things are different on the global energy front. Strikingly different from just a year ago. One of the things that drives the conversation is the speed at which the market has flipped from assuming that oil would be plentiful and low priced well into the future to just the inverse. There was even a catch-phrase to describe this scenario, used as recently as March of 2020-Lower For Longer.  So what happened As you can see below spending on fossil fuels has declined precipitously from 2014, reaching a bottom only last year. Estimates vary from between $600 bn to $1.0 Trillion of capital has been lost to oil and gas extraction since 2014.    WSJ- Chart by author  Two primary reasons have been the cause of most of this capital restraint. The first is prices well below an acceptable rate of return for oil companies for much of this period. Lower for Longer carried an enormous financial impact onto the balance sheets of oil producers, and they did what oil companies do when oil prices drop. They stopped spending...on oil and gas. Even now, with prices that are much higher, domestic oil companies are choosing to pay down debt, buy back their stock, and raise dividends as opposed to increasing their capital budgets. This was discussed in detail in an OilPrice article in September.  The second principle chilling effect on global fossil fuel investment has been the action of governments and activist shareholders to foster so-called green energy alternatives through edicts, tax subsidies, and regulatory barriers. Following the Paris Accords, signatories have moved swiftly to reward investment in these alternative energy sources, primarily-wind, solar, and biomass. This, despite the fact that many of these alternative technologies are still evolving, and lack supporting infrastructure. We have in effect, jumped into the pool and then checked for water. We explored the actions by European governments in this OilPrice article.    International companies like, Shell, NYSERDS.A, NYSERDS.B and BP, NYSEBP are doing some of the same things, but also are diverting capital to renewable energy projects in an effort to reduce the carbon footprint of their operations. In a moment of candor and clarity, in response to an activist investor pushing the company to spin off its legacy assets, Shell CEO, Ben van Beurden said-  The needs of Shellrsquos customers, and the companyrsquos efforts to pivot away from fossil fuels, were better served by keeping its range of assets and businesses. In particular, he said the companyrsquos legacy oil-and-gas assets were needed to fund its investments in lower-carbon energy.  WSJ  These companies are also scaling down their carbon-based operations, monetizing assets up and downstream. Shell in particular has led the way with their sale of their Permian assets to ConocoPhillips, NYSECOP. BP is considering further steps, but has not made any big moves in this regard recently. These actions will result in their portfolios becoming less carbon intensive as the alternative energies they are investing in now, come online mid-decade. Will they be as profitable Doubts have emerged, but this is a question for a future article.  One need not worry about the financial viability of these green energy projects, over the short run at least, as there are ample government stipends in place to pay all or part of their costs. Domestically, and across the pond, governments have paved the road for a green energy transition. The market has already decided about this capital shifting as relates to these companies, bidding up their share prices by about half since the first of the year.  The problem for world energy consumption is that oil remains a fundamental driver of energy security globally and demand is running ahead forecasts with demand above 100 mm BOPD. Prices have gone higher. Much higher, and that could be problematic for the stability of the financial system if the thesis we are constructing comes into play.    EIA  We see oil demand rebounding strongly as we come out of the global recession precipitated by the pandemic. Global growth-we add 120 mm people to the planet yearly, and pent up demand are the drivers here. It comes at the worst possible time for storage volumes, both domestically and internationally. In the U.S. we are near the bottom of 5-year averages for this time of year. 425 mm bbl may sound like a lot, but at 21.5 mm BOPD of consumption, it's less than a 20-day supply.    To no great surprise, European petroleum stocks are down at similarly low levels.    EIA  The great global liquidity influx and a commodity boom  Liquidity or lack thereof is stuff of which financial crises are made. If you hark back to 2008-the last financial crisis that wasn't related to the now winding down pandemic, an increasingly seized up financial system brought global markets to their knees as it metastasized. Liquidity in the form of massive government intervention righted the ship and by early 2009 green shoots were appearing in the market.  Two of the things that precipitated the financial crisis of 2008 were a leveraged asset bubble in housing and a maturing commodities super-cycle. Growth in commodities brought on by the Chinese economic boom led to oil topping out at nearly $150 per bbl in 2008. This boom continued to mid-2014, with oil regaining $110 bbl before succumbing to OPEC's desire to retake market share from U.S. shale producers, and lower growth in the Chinese market. Oil became plentiful as OPEC opened the taps, and prices stayed low for the next 6-years.That is one key difference from 2008 that will tend to extend and exacerbate a downturn if it occurs. Oil is not plentiful and prices are spiking.    FRED  We are now seeing an asset pricing bubble on a scale never before seen. In the span of a year and a half, the money supply has increased from $4.5 trillion to nearly $20 trillion, and there is more coming. The recently passed Infrastructure Plan will bring another couple of trillion of direct and ancillary spending. The Build Back Better plan waiting in the wings for a reconciliation passage will add another $2.0 to $3.5 trillion to the Fed's balance sheet.    FRED  In the past 5-years the median U.S. home price has climbed 68% with much of that coming since the first of the year. Anyone who doesn't recognize the effervescence, or bubblinessnbspin that number may have napped during Econ 101. You can argue that the world has changed since Covid rode the jet stream west, but there is no argument that house prices have not out-stripped wages of this time period.    Once again, FRED is helpful here as it reveals the median household cannot afford an entry level home at $270K. A buyer at the median level with a $25K down payment will only qualify for a $231K house.    FRED  In summary, the present situation has close parallels to the financial crisis of 2008. We think that the current situation may have consequences that are more extreme, as the amount of liquidity pumped into the system is vastly higher. Further, the stockpiles of energy are much lower than in the 2008 time frame, thanks in some measure to the diversion of capital toward renewables, the restraint of capital due to low prices, government intervention, and a rebounding element of demand.  Climate policy will directly impact economic growth  We are already beginning to see the second-order effects of the climate policies being adopted in the wake of the Paris Accords and its offspring the COP-26 love fest in Glasgow this year. I am referring, of course to the energy crisis in the UK, brought on by unanticipated underperformance of wind farms, and under-investment and early retirement of petroleum energy sources, over the last few years. This has all been pretty well documented, and I am not going to belabor them further now.  One of the things that astounds me about the green energy movement is the number of unasked, or unanswered questions related to its full spectrum adoption. Assumptions have been blithely put forward as fact with no supporting evidence. In fact, if you do ask questions you are labeled a climate denier, and ignored or canceled.  So what is one assumption that seems to have not been entirely thought through Let's start with the plan for wind power to provide up to 40% primary electricity generation by 2030, now codified virtually around the world in tax and carbon policy. I ran across a calculation by William Lacey on another site that was quite revelatory. I am paraphrasing his work on that site here in the next couple of paragraphs.  Can this really be done A study promulgated by Arcelor Mittal, the world's leading steel producer is revealing.  ldquoSteel will play an important role in all renewables, including and especially solar and wind. Each new MW of solar power requires between 35 to 45 tons of steel, and each new MW of wind power requires 120 to 180 tons of steel.rdquo  Source  According to the OECD the global capacity to make steel rests at about 2.5 mm metric tons. If we are going to replace the electricity supplied by fossil fuels, about 131 billion MWH, we would need to generate another 6 bn tons of steel. Or about 2.5X the annual present capacity of the global industry. Are we really going to divert 100% of the steelmaking capacity of the planet to building wind farms for 2.5 years What about copper What about other metals used in EV battery production. These are profound questions that just don't get asked.  After Lacey  In summary, I think the unasked questions will begin to be asked at some point. Will it be when some entity wants to build a car plant, and is told, Sorry we don't have the power generating capacity. It is going to happen. It is baked into this cake from the under-investment in fossil fuels.  Your takeaway  I said at the beginning there is a reasonable case that a financial crisis could result from the lack of upstream investment we have discussed so far, and the continuing bashing of the industry that is vital to maintaining our standards of living. As I've noted and world events are beginning to reveal, the hour is very late in terms of being able to respond to a prolonged price spike, or physical shortage of oil. A renewed will accompanied by some acknowledgement of just how vital oil and gas are to our energy security might shorten the effects that could possibly emerge from a financial crisis. But, that is not the trend presently.  Even today, when the ink is barely dry on the Infrastructure bill, our political leaders are sending mixed messages as fuel prices spike. In an even more ironic dichotomy of thought, Middle-East producers are being asked to pump more to ease global energy prices. A request...plea, that they not so politely rejected in their recent meeting. At the same time, U.S. domestic producers are being hamstrung with enhanced regulations, reduced permitting, threats of a carbon tax on fuels, and being starved of capital by key nominees. You can't make this stuff up.  Even the hedge fund Green Energy zeitgeist, Larry Fink of Blackrock is back-peddling a bit on his dire pronouncements, and now acknowledges that-shock-horror, we are totally dependent on oil and gas. As an oily, itrsquos kind of fun to see Larry squirm a bit.  In summary, I am not predicting a financial crisis. I am saying there are strong parallels today to a recent past crisis, and that if one occurs tightness of the energy supply from lack of upstream investment could play a role in its depth and duration.nbsp  By David Messler for Oilprice.com",1,0.9891,"[' ', 'energy', 'oil', 'financial', '$', 'capital', 'crisis', 'global', 'prices', '2008', 'year']"
"OPEC Raised Oil Production By More Than 400,000bpd In October",2021-11-16T09:00:00-06:00,"Led by production increases in Saudi Arabia and Russia, the OPEC group raised its October oil output by 490,000 barrels per day bpd, TASS news agency quoted the International Energy Agency as saying in its monthly report on Tuesday.  Saudi Arabiarsquos oil production rose to 9.8 million bpd in October from 9.68 million bpd in September, with the Kingdom still complying with its quota. Russia pumped 9.91 million bpd in October, up from 9.82 million bpd in September, with a compliance rate of 92 percent, TASS notes.  The compliance of the OPEC group was at 116 percent last month, with OPEC complying 124 percent and the non-OPEC countries part of the deal complying 103 percent.  The high over-compliance of the ten OPEC members bound by the pact is due to a large extent to the inability of several OPEC producers to pump to their quotas.  OPECrsquos crude oil production rose by 217,000 bpd to 27.453 million bpd in October, but still fell short of the cartelrsquos share of the 400,000-bpd total output hike of the OPEC group, according to the secondary sources in OPECrsquos monthly report published last week.  Under the OPEC deal, the ten OPEC members bound by the OPEC pact should be raising their combined production bynbsp254,000 bpdnbspeach month.  Yet, estimates from secondary sources in OPECrsquos Monthly Oil Market Report MOMR continued to show what analysts, tanker-tracking firms, and previous OPEC monthly reports showed the cartel has been undershooting its collective production quotamdashmostly because of a lack of capacity at some members to pump crude to their respective quotas.  While OPECrsquos top producer and the worldrsquos largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, pumped nearly in perfect alignment to its quota and raised crude production by 110,000 bpd, several African members not only fell short of their quotas, but they also saw their respective output drop in October compared to September. Nigeria, Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea saw their output decline last month. The steepest drop was in Nigeria, whose production fell by 45,000 bpd to 1.354 million bpd, per OPECrsquos secondary sources. Nigeriarsquos output was more than 200,000 bpd below its cap of 1.6 million bpd.nbsp  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com",-1,-0.5499,"['bpd', 'OPEC', ' ', 'production', 'million', 'October', 'output', 'OPECrsquos', 'oil', 'percent', 'members']"
Is It Fair To Ask Africa To Stop Pumping Oil And Gas,2021-11-15T16:00:00-06:00,"Sub-Saharan Africa is responsible for just 3% of all global greenhouse gas emissions, but is heating up faster than anywhere else on the planet. Africa is particularly vulnerable to climate change, not only because itrsquos heating up first and fastest, but because the largely under-developed continent lacks the infrastructure and capital capacities to prepare for, mitigate, and adapt to the changes.nbsp  At the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, the harsh reality for African leaders was pushed to the fore. Rich nations, responsible for the vast majority of the worldrsquos overall greenhouse gas emissions, pushed for poorer countries to pledge to phasing out fossil fuels, while leaders of poor countries argued that they will have no chance of meeting their baseline development goals without the continued and relatively minor use of coal, oil, and gas.  ldquoWhen they say cut [emissions] in Africa, what do they want to cutrdquo asked Titus Gwemende, Zimbabwe-based climate director at the Open Society Foundation, in an interview with the New York Times. ldquoTherersquos nothing to cut here. African countries are the ones on the receiving end of this problem. Itrsquos the bigger emitters that should have the responsibility to cut,rdquo he said. ldquoWe should be sensitive to history.rdquo  In the final version of the COP26 climate agreement, developed countries agreed to financially support climate action in developing countries, pledging to mobilize climate finance ldquofrom all sources to reach the level needed to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, including significantly increasing support for developing country Parties, beyond $100 billion per year.rdquo Notably, a similar pledge was made in 2009, but developing nations missed their payment deadlines. Meeting these payments, as well as coming to an agreement about what qualifies for climate finance, is essential for rebuilding trust between developed and developing countries.  African leaders are now in the awkward and uncomfortable position of lobbying for the continued use of and reliance on fossil fuels, including coal, at the very same time that their nations are under dire and increasing threat from the consequences of climate change. While this may seem like hypocrisy, these leaders argue that the real hypocrites are the world leaders from developed nations who contributed most to greenhouse gas emissions and now want to control the industrial development of poorer nations who have not had the same chance to build up their own economies.nbsp  Related Rosneft Sees Possible Supercycle In Oil And Gas MarketsldquoEfforts to restrict fossil fuel investments in Africa are even harder to stomach because many of the wealthy countries behind them mdash including Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States mdash include natural gas in their own multi decade plans to transition to clean energy,rdquo Nigeriarsquos vice president Yemi Osinbajo wrote in Foreign Affairs in anticipation of the COP26 talks. Another defender of African fossil fuels, Blackwater Worldwidersquos Erik Prince, echoed this sentiment, saying that when richer climate advocates finger-wag from their Teslas, telling Africa ldquoto turn away from hydrocarbons --- itrsquos immoral, itrsquos wrong,rdquo Prince said. ldquoWe have real energy poverty across the continent.rdquo  This is not to say that African leaders are speaking out against renewables--far from it. Renewables are simply further out of reach for these impoverished nations who need cheap and reliable energy now, and are sitting on top of plentiful reserves of fossil fuels that have yet to be developed. Itrsquos the very definition of a wicked problem. The extraction of fossil fuels does need to end in the immediate term if we are to avoid the most devastating effects of climate change, but not all countries are prepared to carry the burden of this transition without seriously compromising the wellbeing of their citizens.  This is just one reason why COP26 ended ldquowith nobody really happy.rdquo Developing nations, with China and India at the fore, pushed to water down the agenda, changing the language from ldquophasing outrdquo coal to ldquophasing down.rdquo The pledges are still a far cry from what will be necessary to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial averages. And poorer countries are still looking at a difficult and unclear road ahead on their tightrope walk between development and decarbonization.

Biden's Baffling Oil Policy Faces Backlash From All Sides,2021-11-14T18:00:00-06:00,"President Joe Biden and his administration hardly planned for everything that happened this year. In fairness, no administration could have planned for it soaring oil and gas demand, tight supply, rising prices fueling inflation that has quickly gone from nothing to worry about to the biggest worry for many.  Yet that's not the worst of it for the Biden administration. The president came into office with the pledge to set the United States on a course towards a lower-carbon energy future. This would have been a challenging task even under the best of circumstances, the U.S. being one of the biggest polluters in the world. With the energy crunch, the task becomes almost impossible.  It is no wonder, then, that when Biden started calling on OPEC to boost crude oil production, nervous about rising gas prices at American filling stations, he instantly attracted accusations of hypocrisy. After all, he was pushing an energy transition agenda, he was clearly not in favor of boosting domestic oil production, and one of the first executive orders he signed was the one that killed the Keystone XL pipeline.nbsp  The White House's climate envoy, John Kerry, got asked about Biden's energy policy at the COP26 summit in Glasgow last week. How could the president urge OPEC to pump more oil while campaigning for the phase-out of fossil fuels, the media asked Kerry.  He's asking them to boost production in the immediate moment, Kerry said in response, as quoted by the Wall Street Journal. And as the transition cuts in, there won't be that need as you deploy the solar panels, as you deploy the transmission lines, as you build out the grid.  Kerry's statement is in line with Biden's own defense of his latest moves in the energy area.  On the surface, it seems like an irony, Biden said earlier this month, referring to his call on OPEC to add more oil production while heading for COP26 to discuss the reduction of global emissions. But the truth of the matter is ... everyone knows that idea that we're going to be able to move to renewable energy overnight ... it's just not rational.  Recognizing that the renewable energy transition will notmdashcannotmdashhappen overnight is a commendable demonstration of pragmatism. It is also a recognition of the fact that people need energy right now, and they must get it from any available source. That the sources at this moment are mostly fossil fuels is an unfortunate fact of life that we simply have to accept and continue working to reduce the demand for these fossil fuels.  This seems to be the line the Biden administration is following, and even its critics would likely agree that it is a pragmatic one. The thing is, however, that pragmatism and hypocrisy are not mutually exclusive. Biden's energy policy has already sparked protests from climate activists, calling for an end to U.S. fossil fuel exports and a ban on fracking. Interestingly enough, a group of congressmen also recently called on the White House to ban oil exports but for a different reason the legislators argued a ban on exports would ensure a more adequate supply for the domestic market.  Related Metals Will Be The Oil Of The FuturePresident Biden is in a tight spot when it comes to energy. When he took office, the plan was to steer the U.S. towards a lower-carbon future using the Democrats' majority in Congress. In reality, the majority is so flimsy that passing any climate-related legislation has been a challenge that has involved a lot of compromises. And then came the energy crunch, which nobody expected. Suddenly, the U.S. needed more of all fossil fuels.  It is an ironic twist that the first year of Biden's presidency is also the first year in which coal consumption in the country is set for a rise since 2014. And it will be a substantial rise the Energy Information Administration has forecast the U.S. will consume 20 percent more coal than last year.  Yet using coal to generate electricity more affordably is a pragmatic move even if it leads to a rise in U.S. emissions. The rise, the administration would probably argue, will be a temporary problem, and once the crunch is over, we'll go back to our low-carbon agenda.  Yet this is where the bigger problem flashes a fin. The current energy crunch is not only a result of supply shortages. It is also a result of rising energy demand. U.S. producers appear to be unwilling to ramp up production of crude oil to levels that would lower prices at the pump. Gas producers are having a field day exporting a record amount of their product to Asia, where buyers are looking for a bargainmdashand U.S. gas is a bargain.nbsp  If demand continues to grow at the current pace, switching from pragmatism to energy transition will continue to be a challenge. Over the short term, the challenge will be especially tough inflation is driving up the prices of renewables, too, and threatening a lot of planned capacity addition projects with cancellation because of surging material and component costs.

Oil Prices Fall After EIA Reports Crude Inventory Build,2021-11-10T09:37:00-06:00,"Crude oil fell today after the Energy Information Administration reported an inventory build of 1 million barrels for the week to November 5.  This compares with a build of 3.3 million barrels for the previous week and analyst expectations of a build of 1.9 million barrels.  At 435.1 million barrels, the EIA said, crude oil inventories were 7 percent below the five-year average for this time of year.  In fuels, inventory movements included a draw in gasoline and another one in middle distillates.  In gasoline, the authority estimated inventories had shed 1.6 million barrels in the week to November 5, while in middle distillates, inventories fell by 2.6 million barrels last week.  This compared with a gasoline stock decline of 1.5 million barrels for the previous week and a middle distillate build of 2.2 million barrels.  Gasoline production last week averaged 10.1 million bpd, with middle distillate production at 4.9 million bpd.  This compared with gasoline production of 10.2 million bpd for the previous week and middle distillate production of 4.8 million bpd.  Oil prices got a boost earlier this week after the U.S. government lifted travel restrictions for visitors from abroadmdasha move seen to provide strong support to jet fuel demand, which has been lagging behind other fuels because of such restrictions.  In a further boost for prices, the EIA said in its Short-Term Energy Outlook that demand for oil and oil products was recovering much faster than supply, driving prices higher.  To address this imbalance that has pushed retail fuel prices much higher than drivers are used to, the federal government was reportedly considering the release of crude from the strategic petroleum reserve, even though according to analysts such a release may not do much about prices.  At the time of writing Brent crude was trading at $84.68 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate was changing hands at $83.83 per barrel. Both were down on the opening of trade today.

California Is Addicted To Oil From The Amazon,2021-12-06T14:00:00-06:00,"California is by far the most ambitious U.S. state when it comes to things like emission standards, EV sales, and renewable energy. California is shutting down its nuclear power plants to double down on wind and solar.nbsp  It is also importing more oil from the Amazon rainforest than any country in the world.  Ecuador accounted for a little over 24 percent of Californiarsquos oil imports as of 2020. That equaled 55,219 barrels daily, according to the California Energy Commission. Interestingly, this is a substantial increase from the previous year, when Ecuador accounted for 18.22 percent of Californiarsquos oil imports, and from the year before, when Ecuador accounted for 14 percent.  This oil from Ecuador, according to a recent investigation by NBC News, comes from the Amazon rainforestmdashan area that is the target of massive conservation efforts and yet remains one of the most exploited parts of the world because of its natural resource wealth.  Ecuador is home to the Yasuni National Park, which contains some of the most diverse ecosystems globally, including two uncontacted indigenous tribes. For these tribes, the government even approved a so-called Intangible Zonemdasha border not to be crossed in order to protect these tribes. But that was before 2019. Two years ago, the government of Ecuador approved a plan to open up Yasuni National Park to oil and gas drilling.    Ecuador is a frequent reference in oil news, but the South American country has proven crude reserves estimated at 8.3 billion barrels, which makes it the third-largest oil country in Latin America, after Venezuela and Brazil. Yet, it doesnrsquot produce anywhere close to what Brazil pumps and what Venezuela did before the U.S. sanctions. Its average for 2020 was 483,000 bpd, according to the Energy Information Administration. But this is changing.  The president of the tiny South American nation, who took office this May, pledged to double the countryrsquos oil production and is working on this through some major reforms aimed at facilitating the participation of private companies in Ecuadorrsquos oil industry. According to Argus Media, the rush aims to monetize the countryrsquos oil assets before the energy transition kills demand for the fossil fuel. Yet judging from Californiarsquos appetite for Ecuadorian oil, this killing might take a while.  According to the NBC investigation, which was based on a report by Stand.earth and Amazon Watch, 66 percent of the oil produced in Ecuador is exported to the United States, and most of that ends up in California. As the two environmentalist groups put it, 1 in 7 tanks of gasoline, diesel, or jet fuel sold in California came from the Amazon rainforest. And thatrsquos not all.  Some of the biggest corporate users of Amazon oil in California are PepsiCo, Costco, and Amazon. All three have made emission-related pledges, with PepsiCo vowing to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent from 2015 levels by 2030 and net-zero status by 2040 and Amazon promising billions in investment to become a net-zero emitter by the same year.  ldquoThis is no longer one of those things where wersquore supposed to have sympathy for a crisis thatrsquos happening somewhere else,rdquo Angeline Robertson, a senior researcher at Stand.earth and the lead author of the report, told NBC. ldquoItrsquos occurring in California, and itrsquos linked to Amazon destruction.rdquo  It is also the latest proof that moving away from oil and gas is a lot easier said than done. For all of its anti-oil rhetoric, California is a major importer of the commodity. Before Ecuador became its top source of the commodity, it was importing most of its oil from Saudi Arabia and Iraq and smaller amounts from Colombia, Mexico, Nigeria, and Angola. California, therefore, is very much like any other oil importer in the world with one difference while other importers simply do not have the domestic production to use, California is purposefully squeezing its oil industry.  There are plans in place to ban fracking by 2024, with Governor Newsom saying in May that ldquoAs we move to swiftly decarbonize our transportation sector and create a healthier future for our children, Irsquove made it clear I donrsquot see a role for fracking in that future and, similarly, believe that California needs to move beyond oil.rdquo  This move would necessitate weaning the state off the more than 200,000 bpd of foreign oil it imports on top of more than 460,000 bpd in local production. Itrsquos going to be difficult. There is also a proposal to ban offshore drilling after an oil spill in October added fuel to arguments about whether oil had a future in California or not.  In Ecuador and in the Yasuni National Park, oil definitely has a future, unlike an attempt by a previous government to save its unique ecosystems by calling on the international community to provide $3.5 billion for conservation efforts. NBC recalls the government of Rafael Correa abandoned its plan to protect its share of the Amazon six years with international donations after it only managed to raise a tenth of what was needed. And then it lifted the drilling moratorium for Yasuni, with President Correa saying, ldquoThe world has failed us.rdquo  By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com",1,0.9459,"['oil', ' ', 'California', 'Ecuador', 'Amazon', 'percent', 'world', 'NBC', 'Yasuni', 'government', 'future']"
BP Oil & Gas Will Be Needed For Decades,2021-11-15T15:00:00-06:00,"Oil and gas will have a role to play in the energy system for decades to come, BPrsquos chief executive Bernard Looney said on Monday, adding that the industry should try to produce hydrocarbons with the lowest emissions possible.  Any scenario, even the International Energy Agencyrsquos Net-Zero by 2050 scenario, predicts that there will still be demand for oil in 2050, Looney told CNBC on the sidelines of the ADIPEC energy conference in Abu Dhabi.  According to the IEArsquos Net-Zero by 2050 scenario, in a world on track to achieve net-zero emissions within three decades, global oil demand would drop by 75 percent to 24 million barrels per day bpd, from around 90 million bpd in the pandemic year 2020 and around 100 million bpd in the pre-pandemic 2019.  ldquoSo any objective person that looks at this from an objective standpoint is going to say hydrocarbons have a role to play,rdquo Looney told CNBC.  As the world will not be moving away entirely from oil and gas, the question becomes ldquowhat do you do about thatrdquo, BPrsquos top executive noted.  ldquoWhat you do about that is try to produce those hydrocarbons in the best way possible,rdquo Looney said.nbsp  ldquoIt may not be popular to say that oil and gas is going to be in the energy system for decades to come but that is the reality,rdquo he told CNBC.  BP, like most European majors, is now pitching itself as an integrated energy company looking to transform into a broader energy firm from an international oil major.  BP has said it would cut its oil and gas productionnbspby 40 percentnbspby 2030 through active portfolio management and no exploration in new countries. Shell said earlier this year that its oil productionnbsppeaked in 2019, while Italyrsquos Eni sees its oil production peaking in 2025.

The U.S. Shale Patch Is Back In Growth Mode,2021-11-15T18:00:00-06:00,"U.S. shale production is back to growth mode as producers continue to add rigs onshore. Output will continue to climb over the next year as some large oil firms plan to raise spending in the Permian, which has been and will be the key driver of Americarsquos tight oil production growth.nbsp  Still, the rise in shale output will be slower than in the boom years of 2018 and 2019, as most operators continue to stick to capital discipline, while surging costs and labor shortages are major headwinds to significant production growth.nbspnbspnbsp  Next month, total U.S. shale production from the major tight oil plays is set to return to March 2020 levels, which was before companies slashed drilling activity in response to the plunge in prices and demand with the start of the pandemic. Shale output is set to rise 8.68 million barrels per day bpd in December, driven by an increase in Permian production, according to estimates from Rystad Energy quoted by Bloomberg. In November, Permian shale production is projected to hit 5.043 million bpd.  All projections expect U.S. shale production to grow in the coming months and lead to a 600,000 bpd-800,000 bpd increase in total American crude oil production in 2022 compared to 2021.nbspnbsp  Capital discipline is still key for the shale patch, but some majors signaled in the Q3 earnings calls that they could add more rigs in their Permian operations.nbsp  ExxonMobil, for example, said its Permian production in Q3 averaged around 500,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day, up by 30 percent from the third quarter of 2020.nbspnbsp  ldquoWe may see a couple of more rigs come on here as we go forwardrdquo with a focus on efficiencies, Exxonrsquos CEO Darren Woods said.nbsp  Chevron, for its part, will add two more rigs and completion crews in the Permian this quarter, CFO Pierre Breber said on the earnings call.nbsp  BPrsquos U.S. shale unit BPX plans to raise capital spending in the Permian to $1.5 billion in 2022 from $1 billion this year, BPrsquos chief financial officer Murray Auchincloss said on the companyrsquos call.nbsp  Related Oil Prices Under Pressure As Bearish Factors MountConocoPhillips will also boost activity in the Permian, but as with the majors, it will be a measured approach to raising drilling operations.nbsp  ldquoI wouldnrsquot call it a ramp. I would call it slow steady growth because I think that will build the most efficiency in our operations,rdquo Tim Leach, Executive Vice President, Lower 48, said earlier this month, referring to ConocoPhillipsrsquos plans for Permian growth.nbspnbsp  Yet, other shale operators signal more discipline and unwillingness to increase production. Diamondback Energy, for example, has said it will not increase its crude oil production next year despite the surge in prices.  Annual U.S. crude oil production will average 11.1 million bpd in 2021, increasing to 11.9 million bpd in 2022, largely as a result of onshore operators increasing rig counts, which will offset production decline rates, the EIA said in this monthrsquos Short-Term Energy Outlook STEO.nbsp  In its Monthly Oil Market Report MOMR released last week, OPEC forecast U.S. shale production to grow by 610,000 bpd annually - an average of 7.85 million bpd in 2022.nbsp  ldquoWith the current pace of drilling and well completion in oil fields, production of crude oil is forecast to grow by 0.6 mb/d y-o-y, to average 11.66 mb/d, and to exit 2022 at 12.1 mb/d. This forecast assumes ongoing capital discipline, limited active drilling rigs, completion crews and labour shortages,rdquo said the cartel about overall American crude oil production.    But the oil industry in Texas sees cost inflation and skilled labor supply as the main headwinds to production growth going forward.nbsp  Costs rose sharply for a second quarter in a row, the Q3 Dallas Fed Energy Survey showed at the end of September.nbsp  ldquoThe greatest headwind is skilled labor supply and access to expanding credit on our reserve base loan,rdquo an EampP firm executive wrote in comments in the survey. An executive at an oil and gas support service firm noted that ldquoLabor continues to be a struggle, and wages are at an all-time high because of inflation and printing too much money with all of the free giveaways. We are all going to have to pay for this sooner or later.rdquonbsp  Overall, U.S. shale is returning to growth after the COVID crisis, but the pace of this growth would be much slower than pre-pandemic rates due to capital discipline, labor shortages, and surging costs.nbsp  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com",-1,0.98,"[' ', 'production', 'oil', 'shale', 'Permian', 'U.S.', 'bpd', 'said', 'growth', 'rigs', 'discipline']"
Natural Gas Prices Could Spike As Europe Braces For Its First Cold Blast,2021-11-15T13:00:00-06:00,"After months of rollercoaster moves in European nat gas prices as energy producers and traders jockeyed for position ahead of what could be a brutal winter, all bets are now off as Europe is set to get its first cold blast of the winter season, putting the continentrsquos already scant energy supplies under pressure.  According tonbspBloomberg, temperatures are set to slide starting next week, with parts of Italy forecast to experience weather as much as 2 degrees Celsius below normal. Southern France, Spain and Germany are also forecast to be colder-than-usual, according to The Weather Company. Centrica, the U.K.rsquos top energy supplier,nbspwarned its 9 million customers to prepare for an icy blast that could last as long as six weeks.  Europe, whose nat gas inventories in storage are near record lows for this time of the year due to the continent's catastrophic fossil fuel policies and scramble to promote green energy at all costs even though it is nowhere near read to take the reins from legacy energy, will be particularly sensitive to cold snaps in the coming months, with gas prices up for a second week after surging to records in October. Extra supplies promised by Russia have so far been negligible and Norwegian flows have been reduced because of heavy maintenance.    ldquoThis is going to test the energy supplies across Europe,rdquo said Tyler Roys, lead European forecaster at AccuWeather Inc.  A high pressure system could also bring more northerly and colder air flows over central and southern Europe by the end of the month, said Carlo Cafaro, a senior research analyst and meteorologist at Marex.  While European gas prices have dropped from record highs, they are still almost four times higher than normal for this time of year sending electricity and European emission permits surging. Dutch month-ahead gas futures, the benchmark for Europe, rose 1.4% this week after climbing 14% last week.    According to AccuWeather's Roys, the cooler temperatures in the south will coincide with stormy weather over the Mediterranean with threats of flooding and mudslides. This will bring big swings in wind generation, likely to drive price volatility even higher.nbsp    While there is still hope that November temperatures on the whole could end up being close to normal, they will likely be cooler than the above-average levels for the past four years, according to Accuweather data must be that pesky global warming which the world's billionaires are so eager to spend our money to fight. That could also impact gas storage levels as companies withdraw supplies to meet higher demand, already roaring back as economies recover from the pandemic.    Meanwhile, the number of heating degree days, a measure of demand, will be higher than the 10-year normal during the next two weeks, according to Maxar. But there is still some uncertainty between models for northwest Europe, and forecasts havenrsquot been very accurate lately, said Steven Silver, a meteorologist at Maxar.  The arrival of cold weather in Europe would follow freezing temperatures and snow in China, the worldrsquos biggest energy consumer. Higher heating demand could intensify the already fierce battle for liquefied natural gas cargoes, with prices for flexible U.S. LNG still more attractive in Asia.  The development of the La Nina weather pattern in the Pacific basin means possible colder-than-average temperatures in Northeast Asia during the winter months, but better availability at nuclear reactors in Japan and South Korea, as well as higher domestic output in China, could keep any increases in LNG imports in check, Energy Aspects Ltd. said last week.  Meanwhile, perhaps not having received the latest weather update, in a note published late on Sunday, Goldman writes that while November weather in NW Europe looks close to the 10yr average, Goldman maintains its view thatnbspTTF needs to rally further from current levels to balance supply availability and demand destruction.nbspSpecifically, despite the recent sequential increase in Russian supply, we believe that the scale of the remaining shortfall of Russian flows warrants a $5 upside to TTF from $25/mmBtu currently to $30/mmBtu and JKM to $32/mmBtu to further curtail demand and help manage storage levels in Europe.  The main risk to this view, Goldman's Samantha Dart warns, would be a significant departure of Gazprom's Yamal bookings for Dec21 vs our 45 mcm/d expectation, which comes out Nov 15th. Specifically, a booking closer to the 75 mcm/d seasonal norm would likely bring forward our 1Q22 $17.60/mmBtu TTF price forecast, as lower demand destruction would be required to balance the market.  Of course, should winter weather turn out to be far colder than expected, then all bets are off.

Russia And Saudi Arabia See Oil Oversupply In 2022,2021-11-15T12:00:00-06:00,"ldquoEverybody is predicting a surplus of supply starting from the first or second quarter,rdquo next year, Russian Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Sorokin told Bloomberg on the sidelines of this weekrsquos oil industry even in Abu Dhabi.  The only question is when exactly that surplus will take placemdashbut the difference is only a few months, according to Sorokin.  ldquoInventories have stopped drawing, which shows there is no deficit at the moment,rdquo Sorokin added.  Russia took the opportunity to point fingers at the U.S. government, which has for weeks been accusing OPEC of refusing to increase production to ease gasoline prices at American fuel pumps.  According to Sorokin, the U.S. Federal Reserversquos policy has a much greater impact on the oil and gas market than the supply and demand situation.  This is an important distinction because BPrsquos CEO Bernard Looney, for example, also at Adipec, said that he expects oil prices to ldquoremain robust for some time to come.rdquo    The general consensus among those who ventured to comment on OPECrsquos future plans is that OPEC will stick to its production plans by agreeing at the next OPEC meeting to add another 400,000 bpd to the grouprsquos production quotas.  According to Saudi Arabiarsquos Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, inventories could already begin to rise next month and into Q1 2020, adding that this 400,000 bpd would be ldquoenoughrdquo.  ldquoWe need not to panic,rdquo bin Salman said, ldquowe need to be calm.rdquo  Adipec, the rare in-person oil and gas industry event, also was a platform for discussions about the COP26 outcome. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo expressed his disappointment with the COP26 talks. This is the first COP talks that targeted the oil and gas industry yet didnrsquot involve the industry in conversations about how to slow climate change.  ldquoFor us attending in Glasgow, this was an alarm bell, Barkindo said. ldquoI left Glasgow with this sobering feeling.rdquo By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.com",-1,0.7689,"[' ', 'oil', 'Sorokin', 'industry', 'OPEC', 'rdquo', 'production', 'gas', 'said', 'surplus', 'supply']"
Yergin Underinvestment May Lead To Series of Energy Crunches,2021-11-15T11:00:00-06:00,"The oil industry is not investing enough to meet growing energy demand, including for crude, which could lead to a series of energy crunches down the road, oil expert Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit, told CNBC on Monday.  ldquoI think we should be conscious that one of the things we may see is a series of crunches,rdquo Yergin told CNBC, referring to what he dubbed a ldquopre-emptive underinvestmentrdquo in oil supply while global demand continues to rise.  ldquoWorld demand is going to be back where it was in 2019 in the next few months,rdquo the expert said, adding that there is a ldquodisconnect between the realities of the dynamics of the marketrdquo and the calls from investors for the oil industry to stick to capital discipline.  Yergin is the latest industry expert warning of future energy crunches as the world is not investing enough in meeting the still growing demand for oil and gas.

Senate Majority Leader Urges Biden To Release Oil From SPR,2021-11-15T09:00:00-06:00,"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has called on President Biden to release oil from the strategic petroleum reserve in order to bring retail fuel prices down ahead of the holidays.  We're here today because we need immediate relief at the gas pump and the place to look is the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, Schumer told media, as quoted by Reuters.  Several experts have weighed in on the idea of releasing crude from the SPR with their opinion unanimous that it won't help bring prices at the pump down in any consistent way.  For one thing, an emergency release from the SRP would do nothing for the regular supply of oil in the country, which depends on local production and imports. For another, the type of oil stored in the SPR is not one favored by refiners, so even if a few million barrels are released, they may not necessarily lead to an increase in the production of fuels.  Schumer's call comes after a group of Democratic Senators wrote a letter to President Biden urging him to ban exports of crude as a way of reducing prices at the pump.  In light of these pressing concerns, we ask that you consider all tools available at your disposal to lower US gasoline prices. This includes a release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and a ban on crude oil exports, the legislators, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Sherrod Brown, and Sen. Jack Reed, among others, said in the letter.  As the United States work[s] to boost the development of clean and renewable energy over the long-term, we must ensure that Americans are able to afford to fill up their cars at the pump in the meantime, the authors of the letter also wrote.  This prompted an immediate response from the oil and gas industry.

The 800 Million Barrel Oilfield Getting Boris Johnson In Trouble,2021-11-14T16:00:00-06:00,"The planned Cambo oilfield in the U.K.rsquos North Sea, thought to hold 800 million barrels of oil, faced significant pressure in the lead up to COP26, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson appeared hypocritical in his promise for a clean energy transition while giving the go-ahead on a new oil exploration project. Following the global climate summit, will Cambo go ahead  The proposed exploration would take place in the Cambo oil field, located around 125km west of the Shetland Islands, at a depth of between 1,050m to 1,100m underwater. Johnson continues to back the project, stating that as licensing approval took place in 2001, well before recent considerations for new exploration licensing restrictions, there is no reason to cancel a project that will support the U.K.rsquos energy security in the coming years. If the project goes ahead, operations in the field could start as early as 2022, with Cambo remaining active for the following 25 years. The development could also help to provide over 1000 jobs, in an industry that suffered greatly during the pandemic.nbsp  Climate activists are staunchly against the new development, suggesting that the first phase of the project alone, which will see the production of 150 million barrels of oil, could produce emissions equivalent to running a coal power plant for 16 years. This August, energy activists delivered an open letter addressed to Johnson in opposition to the project, which received 80,000 signatures.nbsp    Greenpeace and other environmental groups used the COP26 summit as a stage to oppose Cambo, holding demonstrations outside of the Prime Ministerrsquos Downing Street home as well as in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Activists believe the U.K.rsquos leading role in COP26, as host to the summit, is contradictory to Johnsonrsquos plans to support Shell and private equity firm Siccar Point Energyrsquos Cambo development over the coming decades.nbsp  Conversely, others argue it will bring in much-needed revenue and create jobs at a time when oil demand remains high and renewable alternatives are not yet well enough developed to meet this demand. For example, Alister Jack, the UK government's Scottish secretary, stated that the Cambo oilfield should 100% get the go-ahead, suggesting that it would be foolish to think that we can just run away from oil and gas, referring to the U.K.rsquos unpreparedness to make a full clean energy transition at this point in time.nbsp  The U.K. government is using this lack of preparedness for the transition to justify the development of Cambo while suggesting that the oilfield will be designed to produce low-carbon oil, similar to projects being established by Norwayrsquos Equinor. In addition, the field will be lsquoelectrification-readyrsquo, so that it can be run on onshore renewable power once it becomes available.nbsp  In addition, Alok Sharma, the president-designate of COP26, responded to questions over the hypocrisy of COP26 and the development of Cambo by stating, ldquoThe IEA report also makes clear that, even in a net zero scenario, there is some element of oil and gas in that.rdquo, in reference to IEA pressure to shift away from fossil fuels to renewable alternatives.nbsp  To date, Scotlandrsquos First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has failed to speak in opposition of the Cambo development, to the dismay of many of Scotlandrsquos youths and climate activists. With approximately 71,000 employed in Scotlandrsquos oil and gas industry, Sturgeon must tread lightly when it comes to energy policy, with tens of thousands of jobs at risk as the clean energy transition moves forward.nbsp  The Oil and Gas Authorityrsquos OGA refusal to release briefing documents relating to Cambo, last month, only added to the controversy. OGA is the U.K. regulator that oversees the exploration and development of oil and gas fields in the region. The request for documentation relating to the project, using the Freedom of Information Act, came after rumors suggested drilling equipment was due to be installed at the oilfield, even before it has been signed off.  In addition, the unveiling this week of a document from Camborsquos co-owner Siccar Point stating that because of the UK's simplified and attractive tax regimehellip Siccar Pointhellip is not forecasted to pay taxes for many years, the U.K. government has once again come under fire. Despite Johnsonrsquos post-COP26 statement, urging other countries to take action on climate change, the U.K. still offers some of the most favorable tax conditions for energy companies running oil and gas operations.nbsp  With Cambo holding the potential for reduced reliance on energy imports, improving the U.K.rsquos energy security in the coming years, the controversial oilfield development looks set to go ahead. However, pressure from environmental activists and the international community could see the need for greater investment in CCS technology and the guarantee of low-carbon oil production if Johnson pushes through with plans.nbsp  By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.com",1,0.9881,"['Cambo', 'oil', ' ', 'energy', 'development', 'project', 'COP26', 'oilfield', 'U.K.rsquos', 'ahead', 'years']"
Will Oil Ever Become Truly Worthless,2021-11-13T16:00:00-06:00,"Could fossil fuels and Big Oil actually become lsquoworthlessrsquo within the next few decades, and what would this mean for the global economy New research suggests as many as half of the worldrsquos fossil fuel assets could become worthless by 2036 if the green energy transition goes ahead at the pace projected coming out of COP26.nbspnbsp  If these assets lose all value, we could be facing a crash the likes of which we have not seen since the 2008 financial crisis. However, earlier adopters of renewable infrastructure and technology could profit from the new economy, supporting the creation of new job opportunities and building a new energy industry.  Governments need to plan for a potential oil and gas crash, ensuring fossil fuel energy operations meet energy needs during the transition but that the supply does not outweigh the eventual waning international demand. At the current projected rate of production, between $11 and $14 trillion could be lost in stranded assets. We could essentially be seeing an experience similar to that of the oil demand drop of April 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic, when oil prices plummeted to minus figures. Except, in this case, demand will not rise again, meaning that oil companies and economies relying on the oil sector will experience significant economic hardship.nbsp  Bill Gates is just one of the famous voices that have predicted that investing in Big Oil would be a big mistake. The tech billionaire stated at the COP26 climate summit this month, ldquoSome of these giants will fall. You know, 30 years from now, some of those oil companies will be worth very littlerdquo.nbspnbsp  Related Saudi Prince Lashes Out At Greenpeace During COP26This prediction follows a fall in the stock prices of several oil supermajors in the past five years, including ExxonMobil, BP, and Royal Dutch Shell. Earlier this year, following a year of pandemic restrictions, ExxonMobil announced a loss of over $20 billion in the last quarter of 2020. The story is similar for many oil firms around the world, those that survived bankruptcy during the pandemic have had to fight to get back on their feet.nbsp  Earlier this year a report by think-tank Carbon Tracker stated that fossil fuel and related companies stocks lost $123 billion over the last decade, suggesting the trend, which is set to continue following COP26 and mounting pressure from international organizations to transition away from fossil fuels, has already begun. Gains in renewable energy stocks were substantially higher, with returns on renewables tripling over the last decade. A positive return on investment was seen in developed countries as well as in emerging economies, suggesting that this is a global phenomenon.nbspnbspnbsp  Henrik Jeppesen, author of the report explained, ldquoClimate risk is now very much a material one that cannot be ignored, and clean energy stocks are rapidly replacing the old order as the choice investment for a transitioning world.rdquo  If correct, the global economy could suffer as hundreds of thousands of energy jobs are lost as the world undergoes an energy transition. Those living in countries dependent on fossil fuel production for revenue and employment are understandably concerned about the shift, putting training and job creation at the center of their focus for the emerging renewable energy industry.nbsp  According to a Morgan Stanley prediction, the coal industry could disappear by as early as 2033, with developed states such as the U.K. pledging to end all coal production within the next five years. Once coal is gone, itrsquos only a matter of time until oil and gas follow. The question is, how much time  Investment in clean energy is steadily rising as the eventual transition becomes an inevitability, totaling $501.3 billion in 2020, around a 9 percent increase in 2019. This figure will continue to climb year-on-year until a total shift away from fossil fuels to renewable alternatives has taken place.  Related Metals Will Be The Oil Of The FutureBut we must not overlook the fact the Big Oil has been focusing on portfolio expansion as investment in renewable energy has become a must for energy firms, meaning many international oil majors will continue widescale energy projects thanks to their expertise and investment capabilities. Several oil majors have already invested significantly in carbon capture and storage CCS technology as a means to make their oil output less carbon-intensive, potentially providing its production operations with a longer shelf life as governments strive for net-zero emissions. In addition, pretty much all oil supermajors have invested in renewable projects such as hydrogen, wind, solar and geothermal power. While this will allow many companies to maintain some of their value, the lack of early commitment to renewables suggests that they will not become the market leaders of the energy transition.nbsp  Big Oil is unlikely to become worthless thanks to the rapid portfolio expansion in renewables by many supermajors. However, fossil fuels have and will continue to steadily decline as investments in renewables increase. Furthermore, states and oil firms around the globe must consider the rate at which this transition will take place to avoid a worthless reserve of oil piling up as demand gradually wanes, which could ultimately lead to a global financial crisis.nbsp  By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.com",-1,0.9874,"['oil', 'energy', ' ', 'fossil', 'transition', 'renewable', 'Oil', '$', 'year', 'fuels', 'Big']"
Options Traders Are Betting On $300 Oil,2021-11-12T13:00:00-06:00,"Adventurous options traders placed bets this week on oil prices hitting $250 and even $300 per barrel, betting for the first time this year that oil could exceed $250, ICE Futures Europe data cited by Bloomberg showed.  On Thursday, options traders traded the equivalent of 5 million barrels of Brent at $250 and $300 call options.  Call options give traders the rightmdashbut not the obligationmdashto buy assets at a certain price, the so-called strike price, by a certain date.nbsp  The amounts of call options at triple-digit strikes have soared in recent weeks, suggesting that more speculative traders are attracted by potential quick profits from options trades, which are relatively low-cost ways to speculate on the direction of an asset.  While $250 per barrel bets are the first call options traded this year, some traders have already bet on $200 and $215 oil in recent weeks, according to Bloomberg data.  Last month, exchange trade data showed that as oil prices hit multi-year highs, some speculative traders were betting on the options market that oil could exceed $100 a barrel by the end of this year and even reach a record $200 per barrel by the end of 2022.nbsp  The resurgent activity with bets on $100 or $200 oil shows that more traders are getting into the energy market amid the global energy crunch, and more of those speculators are bullish on oil prices.  $100 a barrel oil is no longer an outrageous bet, as it was at the start of this year, and even some investment banks believe that crude prices could hit the triple digits as soon as in the middle of next year.  Most recently, Bank of America said that Brent Crude prices could rise to as much as $120 per barrel in the first half of 2022 due to the global gas crisis, booming air travel with international flights returning, and a comeback of Asian demand.

Energy Industry Strikes Back At Democrats' Oil Export Ban Proposal,2021-11-12T10:00:00-06:00,"Energy industry insiders have slammed a proposal by a group of Democratic Senators to ban U.S. oil exports in a bid to rein in retail fuel prices.

The economics of that are pretty clear. And if the suggestion on the part of the administration is that in implementing a ban on U.S. crude oil exports makes US domestic crude oil prices lower and therefore, for example, U.S. gasoline prices lower, that's pure folly, that is not the effect, Ingham added.  A group of Senators led by Elizabeth Warren, Sherrod Brown, and Jack Reed wrote a letter to President Biden urging him to consider all tools available at your disposal to lower US gasoline prices. This includes a release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and a ban on crude oil exports.  The senators also blamed OPEC for the state of U.S. retail fuel prices, which have reached the highest on record in California.  As the United States work[s] to boost the development of clean and renewable energy over the long-term, we must ensure that Americans are able to afford to fill up their cars at the pump in the meantime, the Democratic senators wrote in the letter.  Implementing a crude oil export ban does absolutely nothing, TAEP's Ingham said. And it probably makes prices higher, not lower.

Earlier this week, Nasser said that the world would see its level of spare oil production capacity dwindle next year as jet fuel demand returns to pre- or near-pre-crisis levels.  ldquoExpanding capacity in our industry takes around 5-7 years, and there is not enough investment in the world to increase capacity, this is a huge concern,rdquo Nasser said at the Nikkei Global Management Forum, as carried bynbspReuters.  Global annual upstream spending needs to increase bynbspas much as 54 percentnbspto $542 billion if the oil market is to avert the next supply shortage shock, Moodyrsquos said last month.  ldquoOur analysis demonstrates that upstream companies will need to increase their spending considerably for the medium term to fully replace reserves and avoid declines in future production,rdquo Moodyrsquos Vice President Sajjad Alamnbspsaid.nbspnbspBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com",1,0.3612,"['oil', ' ', 'said', 'demand', 'gas', 'new', 'executive', 'global', 'supply', 'rdquo', 'capacity']"
