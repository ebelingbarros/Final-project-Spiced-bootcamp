$70 Oil Won't Keep OPEC Happy,2021-11-29T19:00:00-06:00,"One daymdashthat was all it took oil prices to plunge by more than a tenth after health authorities announced the identification of the latest potentially dangerous coronavirus variant in Southern Africa.  Brent crude dropped from over $80 to about $72 per barrel, and West Texas Intermediate fell to $68 per barrel in the space of less than 24 hours, days after prices reacted to the release of 50 million barrels from the U.S. strategic petroleum reserve by rising. And with Brent at $72, OPEC is almost certain to halt its policy of supply increase.  ldquoIt obviously remains a wide-open question whether this new variant will truly pose a material threat to oil demand, with vaccination rates ratcheting steeply higher since the summer,rdquo Rory Johnston, managing director of research firm Price Street, told the Financial Times. ldquoBut markets arenrsquot waiting to find out. Sell now, ask questions later.rdquo  This selloff is playing to OPECrsquos concerns about oil demand, voiced recently and likely to be part of preparations to announce a halt to the monthly addition of 400,000 bpd to the total OPEC oil output until it returns to pre-pandemic levels. The group never managed to add 400,000 bpd anyway, as some members struggled to boost production.  OPEC now has more than one good reason to pull supply back. First, the U.S. reserve release move, which also involved other large oil consumers that happen to be Washingtonrsquos allies, had no chance of being welcomed by the oil-producing cartel. In fact, reports emerged almost immediately after the SPR release announcement that Saudi Arabia and Russia, the leaders of the extended OPEC alliance, were already considering a suspension of the output boost policy.  Citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal wrote on Wednesday that the two largest oil producers in the group were inclined to pause the output additions, while others, such as the UAE, saw no reason for a change in tack. After Fridayrsquos price drop, this opinion may have changed.  Related Germany Urges Congress Not To Sanction Nord Stream 2Then OPEC went on stoking expectations of a suspension the grouprsquos Economic Commission Boardmdashan advisory body within the organizationmdashsaid this week the oil stocks released by the United States and its partners would swell a global oil surplus by some 1.1 million bpd in January and February, according to a document that Bloomberg cited.  If 66 million barrels were added to global supply by the U.S. and its allies, OPECrsquos ECB said in the document, the global oil overhang would rise to 2.3 million bpd in January 2022 and 3.7 million bpd in February. Add to this the latest Covid scare, and the halting of output additions is all but a done deal. And it might not end with the halt of the 400,000-bpd in additions.  ldquoI think as we head into the OPEC meeting Thursday, the question is not only do they do a pause but potentially will they actually pull back some barrels because of concerns about this new variant alongside the very large SPR release,rdquo said Helima Croft, RBC Capital Marketsrsquo head of global commodities strategy, as quoted by CNBC.  ldquoWe are going to have a lot of barrels hitting this market, as we have these concerns about new Covid lockdown restrictions,rdquo Croft also said. ldquoAgain, too soon to say whether governments will pull the trigger on such measures, but the market will be concerned.rdquo  Earlier last week, a Rystad Energy analyst described the current situation as a ldquonew and unchartered type of price war,rdquo pitting consumers versus producers. Other analysts noted that the producer club held all the cards, however many barrels consumers released. They still hold all the cards, and their hand is on the oil tap, ready to turn it off.  Related Oil Prices Bounce Back After lsquoBlack Fridayrsquo CollapseJohn Kilduff from Again Capital predicted that OPEC will make its move if WTI falls below $70 ldquoThe battle lines are being drawn,rdquo he told Bloomberg last week following the SPR release announcement. ldquoCertainly, OPEC and the Saudis can win this in that they are holding all the cards. They can keep more oil off the market than a SPR release can put on the market. If you see WTI get under $70, then I would expect a response from OPEC.rdquo  This potential response would hardly come as a surprise in light of the latest on the coronavirus. The new strain, according to recent reports, has already reached Europe, with the UK, Germany, Belgium, and Italy confirming the detection of the new variant. With the continent already on high alert because of rising cases, even in countries with high vaccination coverage, the news would only reinforce fears of more restrictions that would affect oil demand. And the virus appears to be traveling fast.  What the latest events have proven once again is that the pandemic remains the biggest single factor for oil prices. Almost two years in, the identification of new variants and flare-ups in case numbers in key oil markets are still better at reining in oil prices than the deliberate actions of governments.

Why This Oil Price Slump May Not Be Bad News For US Shale,2021-12-02T19:00:00-06:00,"Crude oil prices are plunging under the weight of the latest coronavirus variant news and a speculator-driven selloff. But this time, U.S. shale drillers seem to be quite immune to the trend. Their stocks are not plunging in unison with oil benchmarks. There is no panic in the shale patch. Thank discipline.  ldquoIt looks like the market is starting to reward better behavior by producers,rdquo Josh Young, chief investment officer at Texas-based money manager Bison Interests, told Bloombergrsquos Kevin Crowley this week. ldquoTheyrsquore not getting punished as much on the way down.rdquo  The shale patch was forced into this strict discipline by the pandemic, which last year coupled with trader jitters to cause an unprecedented drop in prices, for a short while plunging WTI below zero. Many exploration and production companies went under. Those that didnrsquot have rearranged their priorities, focusing on returning cash rather than boosting production at all costs.  The latest stock movesmdashor rather the lack of any dramatic movesmdashare one proof that the disciplined approach is working. Another is that production is finally growing, and stocks are not being affected negatively by this.  Rystad Energy said last month that U.S. shale oil output could reach 8.68 million bpd this month. This, the Norwegian energy consultancy said, would be the highest production level since March 2020. In the Permian alone, Rystad sees December output at over 5 million bpd. That would be the highest since 2015.    Drilling is also picking up across the shale patch. The drilled but uncompleted well inventory is nearing depletion at the fastest rate ever recorded, and EampPs are drilling again. This DUC depletion is part of that new disciplined approach. Completing a well is much cheaper than drilling a new one, and there were thousands of DUCs waiting to be finished. So shale drillers chose to complete these in the third quarter in response to rising demand rather than spend more on drilling new wells. As a result, their free cash flow position continued strong, and so did their stock.  It took two market crashes for shale drillers to learn this lesson, but they did learn it well. Before, production growth was the number-one priority trumping all else. This led to years of cash-burning, huge debt piles, and, worst of all, unhappy investors. Now, it is investor returns above all and a guarded attitude toward production growth. Even insistence from the administration doesnrsquot seem to have made a difference.  Of course, it must matter how the insistence was being expressed, and it wasnrsquot being expressed in the best way. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has, in a way, asked the U.S. oil industry to start pumping more oil, but she chose to do it by accusing said industry of raking in fat profits from higher oil prices and using them to reward their shareholders instead of boosting production. Thatrsquos an approach similar to the EUrsquos approach to dealing with Russiamdashand abundant evidence suggests it is not the most productive one.  Right now, prices are down sharply, which might give a pause to production growth, especially coupled with the depletion of DUC stocks. But it will also reinforce the disciplined approach in an industry that has been battered by price slumps often enough to know better. And this discipline will, in turn, serve to limit the downside potential of prices.  How long the rout will continue remains to be seen and largely depends on information about the latest coronavirus variant. Some argue that the current selloff is mostly driven by speculators, although industry insiders note that it has come too far, too fast, Reuters reported this week. This means the effects of this selloff will likely soon disappear as the panic subsides with more data about the omicron variant.  Yet, for shale drillers, it wonrsquot matter as much as before how high or low crude oil is trading. They seem to have found the way to their investorsrsquo hearts, and they are focusing on this after years of sinking billions into production boosts that only served to make the blow of the pandemic harder on everyone in the industry.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com",-1,0.9957,"[' ', 'production', 'shale', 'oil', 'prices', 'approach', 'industry', 'drillers', 'way', 'plunging', 'latest']"
The Double Irony Of Biden's Plea To OPEC,2021-11-10T13:00:00-06:00,"As I wrote in February of this year innbspThe Inherent Risks In President Bidenrsquos Energy Plan    ldquoIf we prematurely discourage investment in fossil fuels mdash and then our dependence doesnrsquot decline as rapidly as the Biden Administration envisions mdash that is a recipe for shortages, higher prices, and greater dependence on foreign nations for our energy.rdquo    Like the Obama Administration, the Biden Administration initially adopted a relatively hostile position toward the fossil fuel industry. The revocation of the Keystone XL Pipeline permit and the temporary suspension of new oil and gas leases on federal lands were policies that signaled that the Biden Administration wants to move the country away from oil.  But what happens when Americans arenrsquot ready to move on from oil, and new domestic supplies arenrsquot meeting demand  Thatrsquos the position we currently find ourselves in. The Biden Administration could respond in one of two ways.  They could say ldquoHigh oil prices will speed up the transition to renewable energyrdquo mdash which is certainly how they feel privately. After all, U.S. officials attended the COP26 U.N. Climate Summit in Glasgow this week, where they discussed plans to reduce carbon emissions. They could tell Americans to take their medicine, live with higher gas prices, and then privately hope that hastens the transition to green energy.  But people donrsquot like paying higher gasoline prices. So, the first irony is that the Biden Administration asked OPEC to pump more oil, undermining its COP26 messaging of reducing fossil fuel consumption. At the G-20 meeting in Rome, President Biden complained    ldquoThe idea that Russia and Saudi Arabia and other major producers are not going to pump more oil so people can have gasoline to get to and from work, for example, is not right.rdquo  President Biden pleaded with OPEC this week to pump more oil. Those pleas were rebuffed, and late last week Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm called on oil-producing nations to immediately increase crude supplies so people wonrsquot be hurt by high prices this winter.  The second irony in this situation is that one country that is producing a lot less oil than it was 18 months ago is the U.S. And policies that are hostile to the oil industry mdash indeed that will ultimately curtail U.S. oil production mdash potentially lead us to a place like this.  Secretary Granholm seemed unclear on why U.S. producers havenrsquot ramped production back up    ldquoI donrsquot know why at $80 a barrel those incentives are not there. During Covid, it was down mdash they backed off because demand was not there because people were staying home, we know that. Now that things are back up, the production should be meeting that [demand], there has been rigs that have been added but not fully.rdquo    There are at least three reasons why production hasnrsquot completely rebounded from the spring 2020 plunge. First, some producers went out of business when prices fell. Some of that production isnrsquot coming back quickly. Second, you can expect that some marginally economic wells were permanently shut down when prices plunged.  But the third factor may be the most important. Oil production doesnrsquot respond quickly to rising price signals. Last year when prices plunged, the number of wells drilling for oil plummeted. Those rigs are slowly coming back online, but there is a lag of months or even years between drilling for oil and oil production. So, oil that we could have expected right now isnrsquot there, because the rig count plunged 18 months ago. The rig count has been climbing back all year, but it is still below pre-pandemic levels.  Because of the lag between price signals and production changes, the Biden Administration needs to make decisions now to ensure domestic supplies are strong during the rest of his term. One of the most important acts the administration could do is fast-track thousands of drilling permit applications that are waiting to be approved.  The administration slowed down these approvals early in the year. The pace has picked up substantially, but that initial slowdown is being felt right now. And that, in part, is why we have to ask OPEC to pump more oil. Itrsquos a bad look for the U.S., but a consequence that I warned about in my February article.  The Biden Administration should learn a valuable lesson from this. An agenda to move the U.S. away from fossil fuels is a noble one. But, if in the process your policies contribute to a supply shortfall and prices skyrocket, you wonrsquot be able to see that agenda through because you will be voted out of office. That is where theory collides with practical reality.  By Robert Rapier",-1,0.8805,"['oil', ' ', 'Biden', 'prices', 'Administration', 'production', 'mdash', 'U.S.', '   ', 'year', 'fossil']"
The Oil Price Rally Is Far From Over,2021-11-09T19:00:00-06:00,"How much higher could oil prices go This is the question that the U.S., China, India, and other big consumers have come to dread as benchmarks continue to rise amid tight supply and soaring demand. The answer right now is not one they will be happy with, either.  ldquoNet, our bullish view remains unchanged the oil deficit remains unresolved, the current strength in oil demand remains a near-term tailwind and the increasingly structural nature of the deficits will require much higher long-dated oil prices,rdquo Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note last week.  The bank sees Brent crude ending the year at $90 per barrel and staying high over the next few years as well, averaging $85 per barrel. Analyst Damien Courvalin said last month that ldquoWersquore facing potential multi-year deficits and the risk of significantly higher prices.rdquonbsp  Bank of America said earlier this month Brent crude could reach as much as $120 per barrel by the middle of next year. Thatrsquos a revision of another bullish forecast that saw Brent hitting $100 per barrel over the next six months. The reason for the revision the now global energy crunch that has seen the prices for all fossil fuels, especially coal, skyrocket amid soaring demand.  According to BofA, a recovery in jet fuel demand, higher diesel fuel demand, and constraints in the refining industry would all contribute to higher oil prices over the coming months.  UBS is also bullish on oil, like pretty much everyone else. The Swiss bankrsquos strategists said in a note earlier this month that oil supply was falling short of demand, noting that oil in storage across the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development was at the lowest since 2015, according to a Houston Chronicle report.  The latest developments in OPEC also suggest oil has higher to go. On Friday, Saudi Arabia raised the December official selling price for its flagship Arab Light for Asia by $1.40 per barrel from November levels signaling expectations for the continued imbalance between demand and supply.  Related Oil Rally Reverses On Signs Of Cooling Demand  Itrsquos worth noting the Kingdom is raising prices even after Chinese oil imports fell in October precisely because of the international oil price rally. Imports were the lowest in three years, Reuters reported, as state-owned buyers found prices too high and independent refiners were constrained by lower import quotas.  ldquoWe maintain the view that we have held all year - that the oil market remains in the early days of a multi-year, structurally strong cycle,rdquo RBC analyst Michael Tran said in a note in mid-October. The reason seems to be the same as for all the bullish forecasts fundamentals.  ldquoMy advice to clients is that you want to stay long oil until you know where that equilibrium price isrdquo that brings new supplies online, said Jeff Currie, the chief of commodities research at Goldman Sachs last month, as quoted by Bloomberg. ldquoWe know itrsquos above these levels because we havenrsquot had a big uptick in capex and investment.rdquonbsp    The industry also sees oil higher for longer. Chron quoted the president of the Texas Independent Producers amp Royalty Owners Association as saying he expected U.S. oil to reach $90 per barrel and stay there for at least a few months. Ed Longanecker cited low investment in new drilling, supply chain problems that are extending delivery times for equipment and materials, and continued strong demand among the factors determining this view.  ldquoOverall oil futures are likely to average somewhere in the $85-$87-per-barrel area through much of the winter, based on a potential colder than normal winter and inventories still below seasonal norms,rdquo said the chief oil analyst of IHS Markitrsquos Oil Price Information Service. ldquoA run toward $90 also seems to be in the cards.rdquo  One exception to the strongly bullish choir is perhaps Citi. While the bankrsquos commodity chief Ed Morse also expects higher prices this quarter, he also anticipates much stronger U.S. production of oil next year U.S. production, Morse told Bloomberg last week, could grow by a lot more than any individual OPEC country in 2022.  The price level of $90 per barrel seems to be the meeting point of many commodity analysts, at least for the immediate term. And with OPEC not coming to the rescue, such prices are fully possible. Even President Biden had to admit the cartel was not going to heed the request and later demands for more oil supply.  ldquoIrsquom not anticipating that OPEC would respond, that Russia and/or Saudi Arabia would respond,rdquo Biden told media on Saturday, as quoted by Bloomberg. ldquoTheyrsquore going to pump some more oil. Whether they pump enough oil is a different thing.rdquo  For now, chances are they will not pump enough to push prices lower, which means the upside potential remains significant, at least until the point is reached when prices begin to weigh on demand and it naturally declines, dragging prices with it.

"Biden Threatens OPEC With Undisclosed ""Tools""",2021-11-08T10:00:00-06:00,"There are other tools in the arsenal that we have to deal with other countries at an appropriate time, President Biden said this weekend, referring to OPEC and its refusal to boost crude oil supply in response to repeated calls from Washington to that tune.  The mentioning of tools in the arsenal came in response to a question about whether Washington was considering the release of some crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a means of reining in retail fuel prices.  I'm not anticipating that OPEC would respond, that Russia and/or Saudi Arabia would respond, President Biden said, as quoted by Reuters. They are going to pump some more oil. Whether they pump enough oil is a different thing.  We can get more energy in the pipeline figuratively and literally speaking,nbspthe president added.  The U.S. administration has been urging OPEC and its partners in OPEC to add more barrels to their combined output since July as recovering demand for oil products pushed prices at the pump to politically uncomfortable highs.  Most recently, the calls have turned into demands and accusations of OPEC threatening the global economic recovery by withholding barrels from the market.  Opec seems unwilling to use the capacity and power it has now at this critical moment of global recovery for countries around the world, a spokesperson for President Biden's National Security Council said last week, as quoted by the Financial Times. Our view is that the global recovery should not be imperilled by a mismatch between supply and demand.  The option of releasing crude from the SPR has been mentioned a few times, including by Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, but for now, the administration appears to be reluctant to tap the strategic reserve. As to what the other tools are that Washington plans to use to convince OPEC to pump more oil, details on those have yet to be shared publicly.

Citi Oil Will Continue Rising This Quarter,2021-11-05T10:00:00-05:00,"Crude oil prices will continue rising this quarter as global oil inventories drawdowns continue and OPEC sticks to its limited addition output policy, Citirsquos head of commodity research Ed Morse told Bloomberg.  Morse commented that it was funny how oil prices reacted following OEPCrsquos latest announcement after its meeting on Thursday, going down instead of up as one would expect. He also noted that OPEC had moved from the role of the ldquocentral bank of oilrdquo to the role of regulator, keeping a cap on supply to keep prices higher.  Asked whether OPEC had the capacity to increase production should demand growth accelerate at some point, Morse said that some OPEC members certainly had the capacity. While some members of the group had suffered a drop in production capacity due to underinvestment, he said Saudi Arabia, Russia, the UAE, and Kuwait could boost production quickly, by about 3 million bpd.  Yet OPEC is not the only player in the field, according to Morse. In fact, he thinks the U.S. could surprise everyone next year by ramping up production substantially. U.S. production, Morse said, could grow by a lot more than any individual OPEC country in 2022.  While the U.S. oil industry ramps up, however, the U.S. administration is experiencing an embarrassing moment, Morse also said, referring to the White Housersquos accusations towards OPEC of being responsible for bringing more oil to the market to keep retail fuel prices lower.  ldquoThis is an embarrassing moment for the U.S. government under the Biden administration, which has been not looking at fossil fuels,rdquo Morse said, adding that production in the Permian was already back to pre-pandemic levels and about to ldquoexploderdquo with production next year.  In this context, Morse expects a year from now, OPEC may have to think about limiting production again as prices would fall dramatically from current levels.

Oil Rally Reverses On Signs Of Cooling Demand,2021-11-03T19:00:00-05:00,"After a nine-week winning streak, oil prices have gone into reverse gear as worrying signs of cooling demand have begun to appear. WTI climbed 11% and Brent rose 7.5% in the month of October, as global oil consumption outpaced supply and drained stockpiles.  However, another crude buildup in the United States has got the market fretting that this epic rally could be running out of steam.  On Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute API reported an inventory build for crude oil of 3.594 million barrels, more than double the 1.567-million barrels build that analysts had predicted. That marked the sixth straight week of crude inventory build, raising genuine concerns that this bull could be on its last legs.  Hedge funds have taken the cue and are beginning to slam the brakes on their oil buying spree.  The latest Commitment of Traders COT report by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows that in the most recent week, hedge funds cut their net long position by 18 million barrels, with reductions in Brent -18 million and NYMEX/ ICE WTI - 7 million, partly offset by additions in U.S. gasoline 4 million, U.S. diesel 1 million and European gas oil 1 million.  In sharp contrast, funds added 110 million barrels over the previous four-week period.  According to the experts, portfolio managers are still bullish on distillates thanks to their high-gearing to the business cycle as well as potential to benefit from fuel-switching this winter in the northern hemisphere as a result of high gas and coal prices.  They clearly do not have the same faith in crude, and for good reason Major economic risks as the Fed begins paring back its bond-buying program.  Economic risks  The US Federal Reserve is expected to start tapering in a matter of weeks, effectively reducing the amount of US government bonds it buys every month. Right now, the Fed has been purchasing bonds worth $120 billion every month, and the assets on its balance sheet have swollen to nearly $9 trillion.  Although the markets have long anticipated the latest round of taper, investors are still skittish due to stubbornly high inflation and fears that the Fed might be forced to raise rates at a faster-than-expected clip in a bid to tame inflation.  Although the Fed has been talking down high inflation numbers as transitory, persistent supply chain issues suggest the issue is more complex.    Source Quartz  U.S. consumer prices jumped more than 5% Y/Y in September, a bigger increase than expected. Economic experts like Harvey and Summersare have warned that people and businesses are experiencing even headier inflation than what the CPI is suggesting. For instance, home prices have soared nearly 20%, while some measures of apartment rental prices have jumped by double digits.    The Fed is in a bind, and now has to perform a delicate balancing act. After spending trillions of dollars on stimulus packages designed to support economic recovery, serious supply shortages have emerged everywhere, from housing and microchips to workers as demand outpaces supply. If the Fed hikes interest rates too soonndashthe main tool for combating inflationmdashserious wage inequalities can emerge, with incomes for women and minorities bearing the brunt of such overreach in the past. Meanwhile, stagflationndashcharacterized by slowing economic growth and rising inflationndashremains a real threat U.S. GDP expanded a mere 2% in the third quarter after growing 6% in the first half of the year.  Indeed, institutional investors are now betting that inflation could hit 3% in just five years, according to the so-called breakeven rate, which is the difference between the five-year Treasury yield and five-year inflation-indexed securities. That marks the highest forecast of price increases in more than 10 years.  Still bullish  Despite the serious economic overhang, Wall Street remains bullish on the oil price trajectory.  After all, U.S. crude inventories are still 57 million barrels below where they were at the beginning of the year, while bullish trader bets still outnumber bearish ones by quite some distance. Most fund managers have maintained long positions in case prices surge further. It's only that their appetite for adding even more to them appears to have faded for the time being.    Source Thomson Reuters  A section of Wall Street believes oil prices still have room to run.  Craig Johnson, chief market strategist at Piper Sandler, says the oil price rally still has plenty of room to run.  We're coming into the winter months and it looks like to me, from looking at an oil chart, we could see oil above the $90 level. It could be closer to $110 to $115, Johnson has told CNBC.  The energy crunch is still nowhere close to subsiding, so we expect prevailing strength in oil prices in November and December as supply lags demand and as OPEC stays on the sidelines, Rystad Energy's Louise Dickson has told Reuters.  Earlier, Goldman Sachs, which had forecast Brent at $90, said the benchmark could even top that by the end of the year.

Oil Prices Slide On Fears Of Tighter Fed Policy,2021-11-03T09:15:00-05:00,"Oil prices fell by 2% early on Wednesday as the market frets about the potential tapering of the Fed's asset purchases that could slow growth and reduce appetite for riskier inflation-hedge assets such as crude futures.  As of 747 a.m. EDT on Wednesday, ahead of the weekly EIA inventory report and before the Fed announcement, both Brent and WTI prices were trading down by 2%.WTI Crude was down 2.11% at $82.14 and Brent Crude traded down 1.89% at $83.10, as the market expects the Fed to announce later today the start of tapering of the asset purchase program because of increased concern over inflation, according to economists polled by Bloomberg.  The U.S. dollar strengthened before the Fed's announcement, further weighing on oil prices as a stronger dollar makes crude more expensive for holders of other currencies. nbsp  Additionally, oil prices fell following another crude oil inventory build estimated by the American Petroleum Institute API.  The API estimated on Tuesday that the inventory build for crude oil was 3.594 million barrels as of last week, which was API's sixth straight week of reporting crude inventory builds. Despite the six weeks of builds, U.S. crude inventories are still 57 million barrels below where they were at the beginning of the year.  Cushing inventories have already drawn down more than 30 million barrels so far this year. And this week, the API reported yet another draw, of 882,000 barrels, on top of last week's 3.734-million-barrel decrease.  The OPEC meeting on November 4 is also making the market anxious amid persistent calls from the U.S. on the alliance to raise oil supply by more than the planned 400,000-bpd monthly increase.  Apart from agreeing on production levels for December, OPEC must also consider what to do with Nigeria and Angola which trail their combined quota by more than 400,000 barrels per day due to various problems, Saxo Bank said in a note on Wednesday.  In today's EIA report the market will also focus on Cushing and whether stock levels there has started to stabilise after slumping to a three-year low, the bank's strategy team wrote.

Why Oil Prices Will Rise In The Short Term,2021-11-01T18:00:00-05:00,"The rally in crude oil and other energy prices has sent U.S. gasoline prices to a seven-year high and raised inflation in all major economies. Economists and analysts have started to worry that inflationary pressure coming from energy prices coupled with supply chain bottlenecks for nearly all goods will not be as transitory as central banks expect.nbsp  There is growing concern that inflation could be lsquotransitory for longerrsquo, and high energy prices and supply chain issues could slow down the global economic recovery from the pandemic.nbsp  Still, itrsquos unlikely that higher oil and energy prices would create such a shock as to result in a recession, analysts and investment banks say.nbsp  Oil prices have further headroom to rise in the short term, according to major asset managers.nbsp  ldquoIn recent decades, there has been no instance in which oil prices have spontaneously declined when supply caught up with demand without some form of economic slowdown,rdquo Reuters market analyst John Kemp argues.nbsp  Currently, the Fed and major central banks expect the strong demand for goods and fuels as economies rebound from the pandemic to outgrow supply shortages next year, including in energy commodities.nbsp  The question in the coming months will be how transitory the inflationary pressures should be so as not to materially hurt consumer spending and factory output and significantly slow down economic growth.nbsp  Related Chronic Underinvestment Could Send Energy Prices Higher For Longer  Meanwhile, major investment banks and asset managers are already predicting $100 oil, especially if this winter turns out colder than usual.nbspnbsp  Goldman Sachs says its year-end outlook of $90 oil could even be conservative as demand rises and gas-to-oil switching could boost consumption further by at least 1 million barrels per day bpd.nbsp  The point of demand destruction is now much higher.  ldquoWe would need prices to rise to $110 /bbl to stifle demand enough to balance the market deficit we currently see in 1Q22 given our expectation that OPEC continues on the current path of 0.4 mb/d per month increases in quotas,rdquo Goldman said in a note dated October 24 carried by Reuters.nbsp  Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of the worldrsquos largest asset manager, BlackRock, said last week at the investment forum in Saudi Arabianbsp  ldquoWersquore looking at a high probability of $100 oil.rdquonbsp  Related Europersquos Gas Prices Soar Again On Lower Russian Supply  Others warned of persisting inflation and slowing global growth.nbsp  David Solomon, CEO at Goldman Sachs, told the same event the world could see higher inflation and slowing economic growth. John Studzinski, Vice Chairman of PIMCO, commented about inflation that ldquoFewer and fewer people think itrsquos transitory.rdquonbsp  Despite fears of ldquotransitory for longerrdquo inflation, higher oil prices are unlikely to bring about a recession in the U.S.nbspnbsp  ldquoWe would have to see massive doubling and tripling of oil prices for it to have such a bad effect that we go ... to negative growth,rdquo Anwiti Bahuguna, head of multi-asset strategy at Columbia Threadneedle, told CNBC last month.nbspnbsp  ldquoAnnual energy costs as a percentage of GDP are above the 30-year average of 4.4%, but below that of 1979 or 2008 when annual energy costs reached over 7% of GDP,rdquo analysts at Bernstein wrote in a note in early October. ldquoIf energy prices rises prove to be transient, then the risk of an energy-induced recession remains low,rdquo said Bernstein analysts cited by CNBC.nbsp  U.S. oil supermajor Chevron believes oil prices would not stay at the current high levels.nbspnbsp  ldquoThis feels more cyclical than structural,rdquo Chevronrsquos CFO Pierre Breber told CNN Business in an interview.  ldquoWe view these prices as above mid-cycle and above what our price assumptions would be,rdquo added.nbsp  Oil supply next year is expected to rise with OPEC unwinding the remaining production cuts and the potential of Iranian barrels returning legitimately on the market. This quarterrsquos oil supply deficit is expected to turn into a surplus around the middle of 2022, easing the upward pressure on oil and inflation, and justifying the current cautious approach of the OPEC alliance in easing the collective cuts.nbspnbsp  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com",-1,-0.8735,"[' ', 'prices', 'oil', 'energy', 'inflation', 'rdquo', 'supply', 'year', 'demand', 'high', 'major']"
Only OPEC Has The Power To Send Oil Prices To $100,2021-11-01T17:00:00-05:00,"After the price of West Texas Intermediate WTI recently crossed $80 per barrel, Russian President Vladimir Putin was asked whether it could reach $100. He replied, ldquoThat is quite possible.rdquo Given Russiarsquos dependence on revenue from its oil exports, he was probably smiling when he said it.  The price of WTI hasnrsquot been above $100 since 2014, but OPEC was a significant reason oil prices originally climbed above $100, and they were a significant reason oil prices fell back below $100.  A key reason the price of WTI originally eclipsed $100 per barrel in 2008 was that OPEC had been reluctant to significantly increase production in previous years. From 2004 to 2007, OPEC only increased oil production by 1.2 million barrels per day BPD, assuring other countries that the markets were adequately supplied.  Meanwhile, global oil demand increased by about 3.2 million BPD during those years. Non-OPEC production was flat in those years, and this started to raise concerns about future oil supplies.  The peak oil panic was a factor in ultimately driving the price of oil to nearly $150 a barrel in the summer of 2008. There were fears that there simply wouldnrsquot be enough oil to go around.  But, another development was simultaneously taking place that would eventually add significant new supplies to the market mdash and force OPEC to respond.  U.S. oil production turned upward in 2008, and over the next six years added about 5 million BPD of oil production to the markets. This was a new market threat for OPEC coming from an unexpected direction. The U.S. had been a major importer of oil leading up to the shale oil boom and had experienced a steady decline in oil production since 1970.  Related Europersquos Gas Prices Soar Again On Lower Russian Supply  OPEC initially tried to manage this threat by cutting its own production to keep the markets balanced mdash and to keep oil prices above $100. But U.S. production just kept increasing, and finally, the dam broke in 2014. Oil prices slipped below $100, and shortly thereafter OPEC engaged in a price war to regain market share. The group rapidly ramped up production, and that sent the price of oil reeling.  Between the summer of 2014 and January 2015, the price of WTI was cut in half. A year later it would drop below $30, and some pundits said we would never again see $100 oil.  Predicting oil prices is a foolrsquos game, that requires predicting the actions of OPEC. They suffered mightily during the price war, but they didnrsquot bankrupt the U.S. shale oil industry. U.S. oil production did decline in 2016 but resumed growth in 2017 as oil prices recovered.  OPEC once again returned to their strategy of balancing the market with production cuts, and up until the Covid-19 pandemic crushed global oil demand, that was working to steadily boost oil prices.  Then the pandemic knocked some production offline that still hasnrsquot recovered - particularly in the U.S. Now that oil demand has risen back to near pre-Covid levels, supply and demand have significantly tightened up - just like in 2007. As I noted in the previous article, the U.S. rig count is climbing in response to higher oil prices, but thatrsquos going to take some time to translate into higher oil production.  Meanwhile, the price of oil continues to climb. How high will it go Over the next few months, thatrsquos going to depend on what OPEC decides to do.

China Releases Fuel From Reserve To Stop Price Spike,2021-11-01T11:00:00-05:00,"China has released gasoline and diesel from its fuel reserve to arrest a price climb that has increased volatility in some parts of the country, Reuters has reported, citing the Chinese National Food and Strategic Reserve Administration.  Diesel and gasoline rotated out of the reserves will be used to increase market resources and reduce supply shortages, in order to stabilize supply and prices, Bloomberg quoted the administration as saying.  Oil product rotation should be more common than crude oil releases from reserves,nbspsaid an SIA Energy analyst, as quoted by CNA. However, the analyst also noted that such reserve releases are generally not officially announced. Sunday's announcement by the Chinese National Food and Strategic Reserve Administration may have been the first ever.  Like many other countries, China has been in the grips of an energy crunch for the past two months as the pick-up in economic activity coincided with tight fossil fuel supply. This prompted Beijing to hold its first-ever crude oil auction for oil from its strategic petroleum reserve in September. The aim of the auction, which was for 7.4 million barrels of crude, was to alleviate raw material price pressures.  The news fuelled the international oil price rally that saw Brent hit $86 per barrel in October. In a bid to cope with the crunch, the Chinese authorities also ordered coal mines to boost production and production capacity and upped natural gas imports to ensure winter supplies after experiencing blackouts and factory shutdowns prompted by the shortage of fossil fuels.  Like all energy news from China, the reports of the reserve release immediately affected oil prices, pushing them lower.  Words are bigger than actions, China learned it from OPEC,nbspSIA Energy's Sengyick Tee told CNA, referring to the effect any news from OPEC has on international prices.

Have Oil Markets Suddenly Turned Bearish,2021-10-28T17:00:00-05:00,"Oil and natural gas prices have fallen over the past few days thanks to a trifecta of bearish catalysts Warm weather, Putinrsquos natural gas intervention, and an agreement to resume talks in Vienna about Iranrsquos nuclear program. After trading above $85/barrel for the first time in seven years, Brent prices were quoted at $83.60 on Thursday while WTI prices dropped to $82.50. However, natural gas recorded the biggest fall, with prices falling 6.3% to trade at $5.81 per MMBtu.  The latest EIA report and Standard Chartered commodity update have revealed that US inventories have been rising relative to seasonal norms since late September. Indeed, the four-week average change has turned positive since early October, partly due to higher-than-normal temperatures, and currently stands at 454 thousand barrels per day kb/d.nbsp  Oil product inventories have not yet begun their usual seasonal sharp draws, so itrsquos perhaps not surprising they rose 10.36 million barrels mb relative to the seasonal average in the latest data.  But this gets a lot more interesting down the line.  Weak demand  More worryingly, implied crude demand fell w/w for all products except jet fuel, with the key mismatch being between total crude inventories and inventories at the WTI pricing hub in Cushing, Oklahoma.  Over the past three weeks, Cushing inventories have fallen by 8.2 mb while crude inventories in the rest of the U.S. have risen by 17.9 mb. Standard Chartered says ample crude availability in the US is clearly not being reflected at Cushing. However, SC says domestic price differentials should be able to adjust enough for flows to Cushing to increase, lessening the distortion of a local shortage. The banker says its models have predicted a slight tightening into December and then a move back into significant surplus in January.  To compound the surplus in the coming year are expectations of higher Iranian exports in 2022 to moderate the upside in the current crude rally.  Putin intervenes  Until recently, the rise in US natural gas prices owed more to fears of a cold winter and the expectation of increased exports to Asia and Europe than it did to domestic fundamentals. The storage situation in the lower-48 states remains distinctly more comfortable than in Europe in addition, while inventories are below the five-year average, with the gap narrowing.  The latest EIA storage data shows a w/w increase of 92 billion cubic feet bcf, taking the total to 3,461bcf. The gap below the five-year average storage level narrowed for the sixth successive week, taking it to 151bcf, 23bcf less w/w and 84bcf less than in the first week of September.  However, the latest developments in the space have roiled the natural gas bull run.  UK and European natural gas prices fell on Thursday after Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered state-run Gazprom to begin filing storage facilities in the continent beginning next month.  Gazprom has allowed its Europe storage facilities to fall to unusually low levels, with critics suggesting that Russia has exacerbated an energy crisis in order to increase pressure on Germany and the EU to speed up the approval of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Russia has denied the allegations, but serious concerns have arisen over the long-term impact of such high prices on future gas demand.  Analysts remain divided on whether demand will continue to outstrip supply in years to come.  Richard Gorry, managing director of JBC Energy Asia, thinks the current gas crisis will likely repeat itself in the future.  lsquolsquoThis will be a crisis that is reoccurring over the next three or four years mdash simply because we donrsquot have a lot of new natural gas supply coming into the market in that period. By 2025, the situation may change, but I think we definitely have a couple of years where wersquore going to be looking at high energy prices,rdquo he told CNBCrsquos ldquoCapital Connectionrdquo in mid-October.  Gorry also points to the natural gas bridge, noting that gas demand has been growing ldquoquite rapidlyrdquo as countries attempt to shift away from coal and oil, to cleaner energies since natural gas is less polluting than both coal and oil.  But James Whistler, global head of energy derivatives at shipbroking firm Simpson Spence Young, begs to differ and says prices are unlikely to remain elevated beyond this winter.  lsquolsquoAre we going to be in an energy crisis perpetually for the next three years Absolutely not. This is a short-term issue hellip come March or April next year, wersquoll see much more reasonable prices starting to come through again,rdquo Whistler told CNBCrsquos ldquoStreet Signs Asiardquo on Wednesday.  Gavin Thompson, Asia Pacific vice chairman of energy at Wood Mackenzie, is also bearish, saying that another energy crisis is likely to lead to the world falling back to oil and coal.  This is already happening as we speak Two weeks ago, we reported that high natural gas prices could lead to a 2mb/d increase in oil demand as power generators shifted from nat. gas to oil. Although oil prices have been rallying, nat. gas prices have recently traded at the equivalent of oil at $200/barrel, making it unsustainable for electricity generating companies to continue relying on the cleaner fuel.By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com",-1,-0.8983,"[' ', 'gas', 'prices', 'natural', 'inventories', 'oil', 'demand', 'w', 'energy', '$', 'years']"
A Cold Winter Could Double Natural Gas Prices And Send Oil To $100,2021-10-26T09:00:00-05:00,"Crude oil could hit $100 per barrel if the winter turns out cold, one analyst has warned, adding that natural gas prices could double from current levels.  BMO Capital Markets oil and gas research managing director Randy Ollenberg told Bloomberg that We're in a really weather-sensitive situation here where we could see natural gas prices really, even, double from here if we get some really cold weather and we could see crude oil prices break through US$100.  There could be some pretty significant increases in pricing here if we do get some really cold weather early ndash so, in December, Ollenberg said. We're talking about cold weather in Europe and Asia, that's really where it's critical.  However, if the weather turns out to be mild during the winter, prices will correct during the first quarter of next year, the analyst also said.  Ollenberg is not alone in this bullish outlook. In a separate interview with Bloomberg, Ira Epstein from asset manager Linn and Associates said he expected West Texas Intermediate to hit $90 by the end of the year on strong demand for oil coupled with not enough new supply.  The sentiment was echoed by Goldman Sachs, too. The investment bank, which earlier this month revised up its price forecast for Brent to $90 per barrel by year-end, now says it could top $90 per barrel. The bank cited utilities' switch from gas to oil as a factor for this revision as it could potentially add 1 million bpd to global demand for oil.  While not our base-case, such persistence would pose upside risk to our $90/bbl year-end Brent price forecast,nbspGoldman analysts said, adding there was further space for oil to grow, too.  We would need prices to rise to $110 /bbl to stifle demand enough to balance the market deficit we currently see in 1Q22 given our expectation that OPEC continues on the current path of 0.4 mb/d per month increases in quotas.

Will China's New Covid Outbreak Halt The Oil Price Rally,2021-10-25T09:00:00-05:00,"China put more than 35,000 residents in a northern county on lockdown as of Monday to contain a new COVID flare-up in the country ndash a development which the oil market is ignoring so far as overall bullish sentiment prevails.  In a bid to quickly contain a fresh outbreak in Ejin, a county in the region of Inner Mongolia, Chinese authorities asked residents to stay at home from today.  China expects new cases to rise in coming days, a health official cited by Bloomberg said on Sunday.  China typically acts very quickly to lock down towns and cities in case of rising COVID cases, and questions remain whether the lockdown this time will extend to more provinces and regions to the extent of slowing down Chinese fuel demand and economic growth.  As of Monday, the oil market largely shrugged off the news out of China, amid a prevailing bullish sentiment with dwindling global inventories and rebounding oil demand. Early on Monday, both benchmarks hit fresh multi-year highs, with the U.S. benchmark, WTI Crude, trading at $84.82, up 1.23%, and Brent Crude sitting above $86, at $86.46, up 0.98% on the day.  The COVID flare-ups in the summer in China led to more lockdowns and oil prices pulling back for a few weeks, with estimates from Goldman Sachs pointing at the time that Chinese demand could be 1 million barrels per day bpd lower for two months than previously expected.  ldquoFor now, the market does not appear concerned about the Covid-19 outbreak in a number of provinces in China. China has, however, demonstrated multiple times that it is able to get outbreaks under control fairly quickly,rdquo ING strategists Warren Patterson and Wenyu Yao said on Monday.  ldquoSome worrying Covid flare-ups were back in the headlines over the weekend, prominently in China, but were not impacting the buying rush in crude futures,rdquo Vanda Insights said in a note.

Brent Oil Hits $86 On Dwindling U.S. Inventories,2021-10-21T09:15:00-05:00,"Brent Crude prices hit $86.10 per barrel early on Thursday, jumping to the highest level in three years, before retreating to just above $85 amid profit-taking.  Driven by signs of tighter oil supply and a bullish EIA weekly inventory report on Wednesday, oil prices rose early on Thursday, with the international benchmark, Brent Crude, rallying to $86.10mdashthe highest price since October 2018. The U.S. benchmark, WTI Crude, settled at a fresh seven-year high on Wednesday and was up early on Thursday before pulling back later in the morning.  As of 1003 a.m. EDT on Thursday, Brent Crude was down 0.83% at $85.08. WTI Crude was trading down 0.74% at $82.75, after briefly trading on Wednesday at $84 a barrel, for the first time since 2014. nbsp  Profit-taking eased the prices on Thursday after they had reached, again, multi-year highs.  Sentiment continues to be bullish after the U.S. Energy Information Administration EIA reported on Wednesday a surprise crude inventory draw of 400,000 barrels for the week to October 15. At 426.5 million barrels, commercial crude inventories remain below the five-year average for this time of the year.  Gasoline inventories were also down last week by a sizeable 5.4 million barrels. This compared with a draw of 2 million barrels for the previous week.  EIArsquos report was constructive, ING strategists Warren Patterson and Wenyu Yao said on Thursday, noting that ldquoWhile the weekly numbers showed that commercial crude oil inventories declined by just 431Mbbls, total oil and product stocks fell by 9.81MMbbls over the week.rdquo  Moreover, crude oil inventories at the Cushing hub fell by more than 2 million barrels, which leaves them at 31.23 million barrels, the lowest level since 2018, according to INGrsquos strategists.  ldquoContinued strength in oil prices means that pressure on OPEC to pump more will only grow,rdquo they said.  ldquoThe reluctance of OPEC to pump more in the short term suggests that oil prices will remain well supported for the remainder of this year,rdquo ING noted.

Iraq Oil Could Hit $100 Next Year,2021-10-20T12:00:00-05:00,"Oil prices could hit $100 a barrel during the first half of 2022 amid low global commercial stocks, Iraqrsquos Oil Minister Ihsan Abdul Jabbar Ismaael said on Wednesday, as carried by Reuters.  At the same time, the minister told reporters in Baghdad that the OPEC group was considering ways to balance the market as the alliance does not want oil to exceed certain ldquoacceptablerdquo levels.nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbspnbsp  An ldquoacceptablerdquo long-term price range for oil prices would be between $75 and $85 per barrel, the Iraqi oil minister said, quoted by Reuters.  The OPEC group is ldquoat the same time against further boosting global oil inventories, as they could lead to the collapse of oil markets,rdquo said the minister of OPECrsquos second-largest producer behind Saudi Arabia.  At the end of last month, Jabbar Ismaael said that OPEC was working to keep oil prices around $70 per barrel. The official said the ministry hoped that oil prices would remain above $65 per barrel.  Since the minister said that the group was looking to keep prices around $70, oil has gained $10 per barrel.    Prices have rallied since the end of September, on the back of rebounding global demand amid weaker supply response from producers, including OPEC and the U.S. shale patch. The global energy crisis and record-high natural gas and coal prices further stoke demand for oil products, pushing forecasts of oil demand in the winter months higher.  While the Iraqi oil minister doesnrsquot rule out $100 oil in the first or second quarter of 2022, he warned the market earlier this month that a three-digit oil price would not be sustainable for the OPEC coalition, which works for stable and predictable markets.  Yet, the Iraqi oil minister is not alone in his prediction that oil could reach $100 early next year.  Oil pricesnbspcould hit $100nbspin case of a colder winter, some analysts and investment banks have said in recent weeks.nbspnbsp  Surging natural gas prices, a cold winter, and reopening of international airline travel could push oil prices to $100 per barrel, Bank of Americanbspsaidnbspin early October.

Oil Prices Dip As China Considers Market Intervention,2021-10-20T08:40:00-05:00,"Oil prices dropped early on Wednesday after China said it was considering an intervention on the domestic coal market to reduce the record prices down to a ldquoreasonable range.rdquo  As of 756 a.m. EDT on Wednesday, before the weekly EIA inventory report, WTI Crude prices were down 1.11% at $82.04, and Brent Crude was trading down by 0.96% to $84.26.  Oil prices continued to fall from the multi-year highs reached early this past Monday, when WTI Crude hitnbspthe highest level since October 2014nbspat $83.73, and the international benchmark briefly jumped above $86 per barrel at $86.04, which was the highest price since October 2018.nbsp  The key trigger of the price retreat early on Wednesday came from China, where the National Development and Reform Commission NDRC said that the government was considering an intervention to reduce the price of coal whose recent ldquoincrease has completely deviated from the fundamentals of supply and demand.rdquo  ldquoThe heating season is approaching and the price is still showing a further irrational upward trend,rdquo Reuters quoted the commission as saying.  The possible Chinese intervention sent the key Chinese coal futures plunging early on Wednesday.  On Tuesday, the most actively traded coal futures in China had hit a fresh record-high after the energy crisis worsened because of colder weather in recent days.  A Chinese intervention to bring coal prices down could ldquoreverse the fuel switch to oil,rdquo analysts at Commerzbank told Reuters.  Oil prices were also weighed down by profit-taking and a fourth straight week of U.S. crude oil inventory builds as estimated on Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute API.  The build last week was estimated at 3.294 million barrels, above analyst expectations of a 2.233-million-barrel build. Still, the API report was not entirely bearish for market sentiment because gasoline and distillate inventories, as well as crude stocks at the Cushing hub, were estimated to have dropped last week. nbspnbsp  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com",-1,-0.9566,"[' ', 'prices', 'coal', '$', 'early', 'Wednesday', 'intervention', 'price', 'Oil', 'China', 'Crude']"
The Battle For Oil Market Share Heats Up Within OPEC,2021-10-19T13:00:00-05:00,"The ongoing energy crunch has put a lid on what seemed to be the ideal bull run for this yearrsquos autumn season ndash OPEC has maintained rigorous discipline even after it concluded a new supply cut agreement until end-2022, whilst demand for energy was growing much more robustly than anyone anticipated. Power consumption mandates, production cuts and electricity shortages have, however, become the new reality of October 2021, reshaping the overall market fundamentals of crude. Chinese buying, always presumed to restart at some point later this year, is now off the agenda, whilst Indiarsquos own post-third wave rally was ground to a halt by an unprecedented wave of power shortages. Against all this, Middle Eastern producers needed to calibrate their November 2021 OSPs very carefully.  Graph 1. Saudi Aramco Official Selling Prices in November 2021 for Asia USD per barrel, vs ICE Bwave.  Source Saudi Aramco.  Saudi Aramco has cut prices for Asia-bound cargoes in November 2021 by 10-50 cents per barrel, with the heaviest Arab Heavy stream seeing the most marked month-on-month change, dipping to a -$0.1 per barrel discount against Oman/Dubai. Aramcorsquos nuanced approach of cutting light streams the least makes sense for several reasons ndash cracks across the Asian petrochemical sector are still robust enough for grades with a high naphtha cut. Second, it will be predominantly Arab Heavy and Arab Medium that would be coming back on the back of Saudi Arabia complying with its gradually increasing OPEC production targets, i.e. ampler supply should generally necessitate a downward pricing pressure which Aramco already anticipates. Third, some Asian customers might be tempted to try out gas-to-oil switching amidst exorbitant LNG prices, therefore conducive pricing might potentially sway them in Aramcorsquos direction.  Graph 2. Saudi Aramco Official Selling Prices in November 2021 for Northwest Europe USD per barrel, vs ICE Bwave.   Source Saudi Aramco.  nbsp  Similarly, the formula prices for Europe-bound cargoes were cut by $0.5-1 per barrel for Northwest Europe and by $0.3-0.6 per barrel for the Mediterranean, meaning that Saudi Aramco is ready to vie for a larger market share after the pricing rollover with October 2021 OSPs. The first OSP cut for Europe-bound cargoes took place already in September, the second month of OPEC supply increases, and despite a marginal increase in flows to 680kbpd in September the desired effect is still not yet there, Saudi Arabia still lacks some 100-150kbpd in exports to Europe compared to the pre-pandemic era.  Graph 3. ADNOC Official Selling Prices in 2017-2021 USD per barrel.   Source ADNOC.  The Singapore marker prices for front-month IFAD ICE Futures Abu Dhabi trading have established the November 2021 OSP for the UAE benchmark, the light sweet Murban, at $73.41 per barrel. Whilst the outright price is set by the exchange, ADNOC decides on other gradesrsquo differentials to Murban and this month it has decided to keep them unchanged, for lack of a strong market hint to do otherwise. Murban is still yet to reach its pre-pandemic export levels of above 1 mbpd, averaging around 930kbpd in September as ADNOCrsquos voluntary production cuts see the last months of their implementation before they are finally tapered off in November, implying that from December 2021 onwards UAE production should not be curtailed by any voluntary production limit.    Whilst overall volumes of traded contracts failed to impress over September, Murban nevertheless managed to pull off a noteworthy feat ndash a spot cargo was offered at the IFAD against a differential to the exchange-traded monthly average and not vs the most frequently used Dubai crude assessment, showing the first real-life signs of how Murban might be undercutting the overall Dubai complex when hedging Murban cargoes the buyer would buy the Brent-Dubai EFS spread which would see him selling Dubai futures. Meanwhile, despite the beneficial prices globally ADNOC has scaled back its downstream ambition by forgoing its plans to build a new 400kbpd refinery in Ruwais that was assumed to be operational by 2026 and providing Abu Dhabi with even bigger exposure to the petrochemicals segment.  Graph 4. Iraqi Official Selling Prices for Europe in 2018-2021 USD per barrel.   Source SOMO.  Seemingly eager to continue the pricing battle with Saudi Arabia, Iraqrsquos state oil marketing company SOMO mirrored the month-on-month changes of the Saudi NOC and cut the November OSPs of its three Basrah grades to Asian customers by 40-50 cents per barrel, with Basrah Heavy seeing the largest cut from October. This should help maintain firm interest in Iraqi barrels ndash after all, the Basrah Light-Arab Medium spread to its lowest in 5 years last month at a -$0.60 per barrel discount and will stay at the same level in November, too. In the meantime, SOMO might no longer offer Basrah Light cargoes for annual term allocations as its recently leaked message to buyers seems to suggest. Overall, the omission of Iraqrsquos lightest export stream should not really come as a surprise ndash if anything, with production getting increasingly tilted towards the heavier barrels, SOMO was never really capable of providing the market with true Basrah Light quality.  Graph 5. Basrah Light-Arab Medium spread in 2018-2021 USD per barrel.   Source SOMO.  With September recording the second-strongest month in terms of Asia-bound exports this year, Iraq has less to worry about firm Asian demand waning than it should rather focus on revitalizing European demand. Despite generous OSP cuts ndash for instance, the largest Iraqi stream Basrah Medium would be traded at the same -$5.90 per barrel discount to Dated BFO ndash export volumes are slow to pick up and have been lagging behind pre-pandemic levels quite tangibly. One ought to note that it is not merely a function of supply and demand, SOMOrsquos crackdown on re-trading and its stringent approach demonstrated vis-agrave-vis destination clauses contributed at least as much as market fundamentals did i.e. Basrah barrels palpably more difficult to trade freely for those not having a term supply contract with SOMO.

With Iran reportedly intent on putting forward additional demand beyond the already-negotiated commitments, the complexity of finding an outcome that would be mutually acceptable is almost too hard to imagine. For instance, the JCPOA negotiating team still failed to overcome one of its fundamental flaws, namely that Iran is negotiating with the EU, Russia and China, i.e. countries that were always in favour of maintaining the nuclear deal, whilst there have not been direct talks with the United States throughout the process, making it all but impossible to strike a harmonious note.    When it comes to Iranian OSPs for November-loading cargoes, Iranrsquos national oil company NIOC followed in the footsteps of Saudi Arabia and dropped its Asian formula prices by 35-40 cents per barrel, though Iranian Light did gain marginally vis-agrave-vis its more sulphurous Saudi peer Arab Light, now trading at a 1.10 per barrel premium to the Oman/Dubai average. The fact that Iran prefers to maintain its Asian prices on par with the mainstream trends might in fact reflect an overlooked sense of confidence as NIOC continues to export crude barrels to East Asian countries. Roughly two-thirds of all exports end up in China even though vessel-tracking data would suggest that Iranrsquos largest market outlet is Malaysia, averaging around 0.5mbpd in July-August and might be the same for September once all the cargoes come out of their lurking.

Energy Crunch Pushes Oil To Longest Weekly Bull Run Since 2015,2021-10-15T09:00:00-05:00,"Oil prices rose early on Friday, with WTI Crude set for its eighth consecutive weekly gain for the longest weekly winning streak since 2015 and Brent briefly topping $85 a barrel as energy markets continue to tighten ahead of the winter.  As of 846 a.m. EDT, WTI Crude prices were up 0.68% at $81.88. Brent Crude, the international benchmark, traded at $84.81, up 0.94%, after having briefly hit $85.09 earlier in the day.  The rally in energy commodities, the switch from gas to oil amid record-high natural gas prices, and the tight control over supply from the OPEC group continue to push oil prices higher.  Early on Friday, WTI Crude was poised for its best consecutive weekly performance since 2015, according to Bloomberg estimates.nbsp  The oil market received a major boost on Thursday when the International Energy Agency IEA said in its monthly report that the energy crisis had spurred a switch to oil products from natural gas. This, the IEA says, could raise global oil demand by 500,000 barrels per day bpd compared with ldquonormal conditions,rdquo or a market in which energy and power prices are not setting record highs.    Due to expectations of higher oil demand from the gas-to-oil switch, the IEA raised its demand forecast for both 2021 and 2022. This year, global oil demand is now expected to grow by 5.5 million bpd from 2020, the agency said, revising up its growth forecast by 170,000 bpd from last month. Next year, demand will rise by another 3.3 million bpd from 2021. This is an upward revision by 210,000 bpd compared to last monthrsquos projection. In 2022, global oil demand is expected to reach 99.6 million bpd, ldquoslightly above pre-Covid levels,rdquo the IEA said. nbsp  U.S. data from Thursday showing a slump in stocks at the Cushing hub also supported prices on Friday, Vanda Insights said.  OPEC also gave fresh impetus to oil bulls after the Saudi Energy Minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, basically ruled out the option that the alliance would respond to the oil price rally by adding more supply than planned, when an oversupply is expected on the market next year.  ldquoWe should look way beyond the tip of our noses.

Oil Prices Rise As Fears Of Omicron Lockdowns Subside,2021-12-07T09:30:00-06:00,"Oil prices rose early on Tuesday for the second day in a row, as traders are cautiously optimistic that the new Omicron COVID variant would not lead to massive lockdowns around the world to the point of severely reducing global oil demand. nbsp  As of 1000 a.m. EST on Tuesday, WTI Crude was up 2.85% at $71.55 and Brent Crude had gained 2.30% to $74.86.  Oil prices had started to rebound on Monday after Saudi Arabia signaled optimism about demand by hiking its official January crude oil selling prices for Asia and the United Statesmdashits biggest markets. Amid heightened worry about the course of the pandemic after the emergence of Omicron, Saudi Arabia injected a dose of confidence in markets by raising its official selling price for its flagship Arab Light to a nearly two-year high.  The market was also relieved on Monday that early reports into Omicron have shown milder symptoms, although the variant is thought to be much more transmissible.  ldquoAlthough itrsquos too early to make any definitive statements about it, thus far it does not look like therersquos a great degree of severity to it,rdquo the White Housersquos chief medical advisor, Dr. Anthony Fauci, told CNN on Monday, but cautioned it was still too early to make sweeping assessments of the severity of the variant. ldquoThe signals are a bit encouraging,rdquo he added.  ldquoInvestors have begun to recalibrate their assessment of the economic impact of the Omicron, setting aside the worst fears triggered by news of the heavily-mutated variant about 10 days ago,rdquo Vanda Insights said in a note on Tuesday.  ldquoYesterdayrsquos optimism can quickly turn into gloom again unless scientific evidence confirms that the economic impact of the latest variant is, in fact, negligible. Yesterdayrsquos impressive performance is being followed-through this morning, partly due to a decent jump in Chinese crude oil imports last month,rdquo broker PVM Oil Associates commented on the oil market on Tuesday.

This Key Indicator Is Pointing To Higher Oil Prices,2021-10-12T10:00:00-05:00,"Wild spikes in the prompt timespread for oil product futures in the United States have suggested that crude oil supply is set to tighten further, adding upward pressure to prices, Bloomberg has reported.  According to the report, the timespread, which is the price difference between oil derivative futures for immediate delivery and those for delivery during the next month, has logged intraday differences of as much as $0.54.  It normally moves by just a few cents a day.  According to some observers, this means that the government may soon start releasing oil from its strategic reservemdashsomething there have been reports about as Washington struggles to keep prices at the pump under control.

Oil extended the rally from last week, which saw the U.S. benchmark topping the $80 per barrel for the first time since 2014.  Chinarsquos coal and power crisis worsened over the weekend, with coal futures in China closing at a new record high on Monday after sixty coal mines in the countryrsquos top coal-producing region were forced to shut amid heavy rain, flooding, and landslides. The weather-related setbacks for Chinese coal production come at a time when the worldrsquos second-largest economy is grappling with a shortage of coal supply and a power crisis, which threaten to slow economic growth.  Europersquos natural gas prices rose on Monday, after the softness seen at the end of last week, following forecasts of colder weather.

Oil prices were headed to a 4-percent gain this week amid restricted supply and rising demand, also due to a gas-to-oil switch amid record-high natural gas prices in Europe and Asia.

One Of Wall Street's Biggest Oil Bears Sees Higher Crude Prices On The Horizon,2021-10-07T18:00:00-05:00,"There has been a major dichotomy on Wall Street regarding the oil price trajectory, with some viewing the massive oil and gas rally as being temporary and transitory while the bulls have been saying this rally still has legs to run.nbsp  Standard Chartered Global Research has been providing regular commodities updates, and made waves in August when they declared that a Brent price of $65/bbl or lower was more likely than $75/bbl or higher. Stanchart said its bearish view was informed by the fact that ...a significant amount of money has already entered the market in the Wall Street-generated belief mistaken according to our analysis that the balances are much tighter and justify USD 80-100/bbl.  More recently, Stanchart maintained its bearish tone, saying that the oil price rally is not fully justified, and that the fundamental case for USD 80/bbl is not any stronger today than it was a few months ago.  Well, the energy bull market has continued defying all bearish expectations, and has forced Stanchart to do a 180 and join the bull camp.  In its latest commodity update, coming shortly after the October 4th OPEC meeting, Stanchart analysts say  We think the market has concluded that OPEC does not see USD 80 per barrel bbl as a ceiling, and that it is unlikely to cool prices in the short term. These factors lead us to change our price views we raise our 2021 average Brent price forecast by USD 6/bbl to USD 71/bbl, and our 2022 forecast by USD 8/bbl to USD 67/bbl. We see the market as, at best, balanced over the next six months even with a high estimate of 700kb/d of substitution from gas to oil and with no OPEC increases after December. Our view is broadly in line with that of the Energy Information Administration EIA and is more bullish than that of the OPEC Secretariat, particularly for Q1. Our own and other models imply that extreme tightness is a market fear rather than a base case however, OPEC has yet to address that fear.    Terse OPEC Meeting  Stanchart's sudden bullishness has been informed by OPEC latest meeting, a short and terse affair followed by a brief press release with no discussion of either crude prices or the spill-over from overheating gas markets. OPEC confirmed that it would stick to its July agreement to boost output by 400,000 barrels per day bpd each month until at least April 2022 to phase out 5.8 million bpd of existing production cuts.  In effect, the ministers failed to challenge the market narrative that assumes tight balances and an associated lack of spare capacity, meaning prices are likely to remain elevated for longer than anticipated. This also suggests that the oil producers are willing to defend a higher price floor than what many previously thought.  But just how high  The bulls have received yet another shot in the arm after J.P. Morgan's global markets strategy team came out and encouraged investors to buy on any dips despite the recent spike in energy prices because the economy can support $150 oil.  For instance, the economy and the consumer were functioning just fine in the period over 2010-2015, when oil averaged $100. Adjusting for inflation, consumer balance sheets, total oil expenditures, wages, and prices of other assets housing, stocks, etc. we think even with oil at $130 or $150 equity markets and the economy could function well with some rebalancing at capital rotation, JPM strategist Marko Kolanovic has said.  JPM isnbspnot the only ultrabull.  Opportune LLP says the U.S. economy is headed for pandemic-induced hyperinflation, arguing that what took five years to do with the last QE has now been duplicated in less than a year. The analysts say that with such rapid expansion of the money supply, it's only a question of when hyperinflation will hit. The experts argue that given the government's insatiable appetite for spending, the dollar could be set for massive devaluation that will propel WTI prices north of $180/bbl by the end of 2022.  With OPEC willing to defend higher oil prices and the Biden administration discouraging drilling at home, it appears that its sole option to push prices lower is to start selling its strategic oil reserves.

Oil Prices Fall Further On Possible Emergency Reserve Release And Export Ban,2021-10-07T09:00:00-05:00,"A release of crude oil from the U.S. emergency reserve is one option the Department of Energy is considering in a bid to tame prices at the gas pump. Another is a ban on oil exports, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said, as quoted by the Financial Times.  Granholm called the emergency reserve release and the export ban tools, saying ldquoall tools are on the tablerdquo as the administration tries to bring gasoline prices under control.  U.S. prices at the pump are at seven-year highs thanks to a strong rebound in demand coinciding with higher international oil prices, according to the AAA, which earlier this month reported that the U.S. average stood at $3.20 per gallon, which was $1.02 more than the average this time last year.  ldquoGlobal economic uncertainty and supply chain concerns caused by the lingering COVID-19 pandemic could be playing a role in keeping crude oil prices elevated,rdquo AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross said in a statement earlier this week.  The Biden administration has, since its entry into office, signaled that it would wage war on the U.S. oil and gas industry as it seeks to implement an ambitious energy transition agenda leaning heavily on the electrification of transport. However, this agenda has clashed with the political realities of gas prices and ruling party popularity just a year before midterms.  It was this clash and the eventual prevailing of political realities that had the White House reach out to OPEC and ask it to boost production as a way of taming U.S. retail gasoline prices. OPEC, however, dug its heels in and refused to cooperate, forcing the Biden administration to consider alternative measures.  ldquoSPR [releases] came on the table a nanosecond after Jake Sullivan was rebuffed in Riyadh and the administration realizednbspshale producersnbspwouldnrsquot be able to increase production quickly enough,rdquo Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, told the FT.By Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com  More Top Reads from Oilprice.com    WTI Crude Oil Price Hits 7-Year High  The Real Reason OPEC Refused To Boost Production Further  Natural Gas Stocks To Watch As The Energy Crisis Goes Global",-1,-0.7968,"[' ', 'prices', 'oil', 'U.S.', 'Energy', 'administration', 'gas', 'year', 'OPEC', 'release', 'crude']"
Saudi Arabia Cuts Oil Prices After Latest Rally,2021-10-06T09:00:00-05:00,"Saudi Arabia has cut its official crude oil selling price for Asian buyers following the latest price rise spurred by the OPEC decision to stick to monthly additions of 400,000 bpd in total rather than boosting output more to cap international prices.  Bloomberg reports that Aramco had cut the prices for all grades for its biggest market, with Arab Light now selling for $0.40 per barrel less, for a total price of $1.30 above the Dubai benchmark.  It is the lowest premium since March.  The Kingdom also cut the prices for most of its oil shipments to the Mediterranean Northwest Europe and the United States.  Earlier this week, Aramco's chief executive Amin Nasser said the global gas crunch had boosted oil demand by half a million barrels daily. Nasser also said he expected oil demand to reach 99 million bpd by the end of this year and rise further to top 100 million bpd in 2022. This appears to have strengthened Aramco's resolve to boost its maximum sustained production capacity to 13 million bpd.  Our maximum sustained capacity from 12 to 13 million bpd... is not going to come to full capacity at 13 million bpd until 2027,nbspNasser said, however, asnbspquotednbspby Reuters, during an energy conference.  With the demand outlook so bright and prices so favorable, it makes sense for the world's top exporter of oil to give buyers a little break and lower prices. Bloomberg notes that Asia accounts for as much as 60 percent of Aramco's oil exports.  International crude oil prices, meanwhile, continue strong. At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading above $82 per barrel, with West Texas Intermediate climbing closer to $79 per barrel. The trend reflects the shift from gas to oil for some power plants as gas becomes prohibitively expensive.

The U.S. federal government stepped in with a broad array of measures, pumping about $4 trillion into the economy sending cash directly to households, boosting unemployment benefits, and creating several new grant and loan programs for businesses.  It was not long before politically influential players such as Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania started warning of elevated asset prices and signs of inflation thanks to the unprecedented level of government largesse. More alarmingly, economic experts chimed in with even more dire warnings of hyperinflation. For instance, last year, the New York Times bestselling author and founder of 'The Bear Traps Report' Lawrence 'Larry' McDonald warned of the 'cobra effect' whereby the stimuli designed to save the economynbspwill instead ...cause a hyperinflationary economic collapse.  True to word, U.S. inflation quickly shot up and has remained stubbornly high, fueled by rising consumer demand, supply chain constraints, and a commodity price boom, including the huge oil and gas rally. In August, the consumer price index or CPI rose by 5.4% on a year-over-year basis, marking the largest such increase since July 2008.  Oil prices and inflation are connected in a cause-and-effect relationship. As oil prices climb, inflation tends to follow in the same direction. On the other hand, inflation tends to fall in tandem with falling oil prices. That's the case because oil is a major input in the economy, and if input costs rise, so should the cost of end products.  Oil Prices and Inflation  President Joe Biden has lately sought to soothe fears that rising inflation could hurt the U.S. recovery and undermine his $4-trillion spending plans. This comes after U.S. inflation has skyrocketed even as the economy continues to recover following the Covid-19 related lockdowns.Rising inflation is mainly being driven by demand for goods and services outpacing the ability of companies to keep up with supply-side bottlenecks hampering diverse industries, including the semiconductor and solar sectors. Significant stimulus funding, as well as a surge in the U.S. personal savings rate, has added to this.  Related Natural Gas Stocks To Watch As The Energy Crisis Goes Global  Republicans have already seized on the alarming inflation trend to oppose Biden's ambitious spending plans saying the country can ill-afford additional government spending proposals that might juice the economy.nbsp  The Biden administration will probably be feeling a little jittery about high oil and gasoline prices not only because of the role that oil has historically played in dictating inflation trends but also because of the risk they pose to his future political ambitions. It's a well-known fact that gas prices have an outsized impact on the consumer psyche.nbsp  Gas prices currently sit at an average of $3.20 per gallon nationally. While that is only about 25 cents higher than the average during the last 10 years, it's more than a full dollar higher than prices last year.  Thankfully, the oil-inflation nexus has weakened considerably since the 1980s.  For instance, during the 1990s and the Gulf War oil crisis, inflation remained stable despite crude oil prices doubling in six months to around $30 from $14. This decoupling between the two metrics became even more apparent during the 1999 to 2005 oil price rally when the annual average nominal price of oil rose to $50 from $16.50 while CPI rose by a much smaller margin to 196.80 in Dec. 2005 from 164.30 in Jan. 1999.  The price correlation between crude and gasoline has changed quite a lot over the years - in ways that do not favor the consumer. Most states have raised gas taxes, refiners face new rules that add cost and there's a shortage of drivers for the trucks that deliver gas to filling stations.  Is high inflation bullish for oil  The relationship between high oil prices and high inflation is, therefore, not quite as simple or straightforward.  Indeed, some experts have even made a somewhat roundabout argument that high inflation and a weakening dollar will push oil prices higher and not the other way round.  Opportune LLP says the U.S. economy is headed for pandemic-induced hyperinflation, arguing that what took five years to do with the last QE has now been duplicated in less than a year. The analysts say that with such rapid expansion of the money supply, it's only a question of when hyperinflation will hit.    Source JD Supra  The analysts say that their models currently value West Texas Intermediate WTI crude oil in the $90/bbl range, good for nearly 16% upside compared to current oil prices.nbsp  But here's where it gets interesting The experts argue that given the government's insatiable appetite for spending, the dollar could be set for massive devaluation that will propel WTI prices north of $180/bbl by the end of 2022.  We are not quite sanguine about those ultra-bullish prospects for the simple reason that they would not go down well with the Biden administration.  Related WTI Crude Oil Price Hits 7-Year High  According to petroleum analyst Patrick De Haan of GasBuddy, one-hundred-dollar oil today could get us close to the $4 per gallon mark. The $4 threshold is regarded as an unmistakable pain point for drivers, with $4.17 being the all-time high for gas prices after oil prices hit $145/bbl in the summer of 2008.  This is not lost on Republicans, who have again seized the moment and are blaming Biden for rising gas prices.  The government still has the option to sell its strategic oil reserves if the oil rally shows no signs of slowing down and if OPEC or even U.S. shale producers fail to beat it to the punch, as Pimco analysts recently pointed out.

WTI Crude Oil Price Hits 7-Year High,2021-10-05T09:00:00-05:00,"The benchmark U.S. oil price jumped on Tuesday morning, hitting the highest level in seven years after OPEC decided to continue making only small monthly additions to oil supply. nbspnbsp  As of 757 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, the U.S. oil price, WTI Crude, was up by 0.98% on the day at $78.41. This is the highest level since 2014, before prices crashed.  Brent Crude, the international benchmark, was also up to a multi-year high. After closing up 2.5 percent at $81.62 on Mondaymdashthe highest level since October 2018mdashBrent prices had risen above $82 on Tuesday morning and traded at $82.24, up 1.16%, at 757 a.m. EDT.  Mondayrsquos decision of the OPEC group to keep plans for easing the cuts unchangedmdashdespite calls for more supply from consuming countries, including the United Statesmdashcontinued to drive the market on Tuesday.  ldquoThe lack of urgency alarmed traders who reacted by sending Brent to a three-year and WTI to a near seven-year high,rdquo Saxo Bank said in a Tuesday note.  ldquoThe risk of higher prices is real with demand destruction the next focus, but in the winter months ahead, this level could be substantially higher,rdquo the bankrsquos strategy team said.  In addition, oil was caught again in the broader energy price rally, which saw record-high gas prices in Europe, yet again, and coal prices in Europe and Asia surging to multi-year highs.  Rallying gas prices are already boosting oil demand with gas-to-oil switch, especially in Asia, Amin Nasser, chief executive officer of Saudi oil giant Aramco said at the Energy Intelligence forum on Monday. Oil consumption has increased by around 500,000 barrels per day bpd since the natural gas crunch began, Nasser said, as carried by Bloomberg.  ldquoThere is some shift we have seen from gas to liquids, especially in certain markets in Asia,rdquo the executive noted.

Bank Of America Energy Crunch Could Lead To $100 Oil And Economic Crisis,2021-10-01T11:00:00-05:00,"Surging natural gas prices, a cold winter, and reopening of international airline travel could push oil prices to $100 per barrel and trigger the next economic crisis, Bank of America says.  Last month, the bank had already said that oil prices could hit $100 per barrel over the next six months if we have a colder-than-usual winter, which could be the most important driver of global energy markets in the coming months. nbsp  Now Bank of America says that oil potentially soaring to $100 could be the trigger to a global crisis due to high inflationary pressure.  In a note on Friday carried by Bloomberg, BofA said that gas-to-oil switching with record-high natural gas prices could spur a lot of additional oil demand, especially diesel. Then, a colder than usual winter would also push energy demand and prices higher, while a reopening of the U.S. borders for international travel would boost demand for jet fuel.  ldquoIf all these factors come together, oil prices could spike and lead to a second round of inflationary pressures around the world,rdquo BofA analysts wrote in the note.  ldquoPut differently, we may just be one storm away from the next macro hurricane,rdquo the bank says, as carried by Bloomberg.  As oil prices briefly broke above $80 a barrel earlier this week, fears of persistent inflation around the world have risen as commodity prices soar. High prices of energy commodities, including of crude oil, are set to further raise inflation which is already higher than Fed and central banksrsquo targets. Currently, inflationary pressures are seen as mostly transitory. Yet, sustained high oil prices would put more pressure on prices.  BofA is bullish on oil not only in the near term, but in the longer term as well, due to the chronic underinvestment in new supply, driven by last yearrsquos crisis and the net-zero commitments of energy companies and governments.  ldquoA multiyear run up in crude oil prices is now in the cards,rdquo Bank of America notes.

The Recent Oil Price Rally Can't Be Justified,2021-09-30T18:00:00-05:00,"After a fairytale run that saw Brent temporarily cross the magical $80/bbl mark for the first time in three years, the crude rally has taken a breather thanks to a surprise build in crude inventories.  On Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute API reported a build in crude oil inventories of 4.127 million barrels for the week ending September 24, contrary to analystsrsquo consensus of a loss of 2.33 million barrels. API had reported a draw in oil inventories of 6.108 million barrels in the previous week, well above expectations of a draw of 2.40 million barrels.  Nevertheless, Brent settled at USD 78.17/bbl on 30th September for a w/w gain of USD 4.25/bbl, while WTI for November delivery rose USD 4.11/bbl w/w to USD 74.25/bbl.nbsp  Despite the latest surprise build, itrsquos worth noting that oil inventories in the United States have drawn down nearly 73 million barrels so far this year - well below pre-pandemic levels. The latest data by the U.S. Energy Information Administration EIA suggests that crude oil inventories in the United States are now 8% under the five-year average for this time of year, at 414 million barrels.  The Standard Chartered commodities desk has offered a rather bearish oil price outlook, arguing that the fundamental case for USD 80/bbl is not any stronger today than it was a few months ago.  The technical side  According to Stanchart strategists, the move in Brent seemed to come straight out of a technical trading textbook the market had held key support last week and then recorded a double inside day consecutive days of lower highs and higher lows before exceeding the 2021 high and breaking out further to the upside.  The move higher also reflected developments in broader risk asset markets, in particular mirroring the market for 10Y US Treasuries. The gains continued along the oil price curve, with further-out values reversing their recent weakness. Brent for delivery five years out gained USD 2.61/bbl w/w, settling at a three-month high of 59.66/bbl on 27 September. Oil prices broke out to the upside, with Brent pushing above USD 80/bbl thanks to highly positive technical factors and supportive cross-asset developments helped the move to USD 80/bbl stick this time, in contrast to the stalled push higher in early July and the subsequent weakness. In the 12 weeks since the failed push higher, prices swung lower by USD 13/bbl before rallying USD 16/bbl back towards USD 80/bbl.nbsp    Stanchart, however, says it remains skeptical that the fundamental case for USD 80/bbl is any stronger today than it was in early July. Indeed, the analysts say market balances have weakened in the intervening period. Market expectations of a strong global stock draw in July were not met, and August and September appear to show slight global surpluses, with global demand having remained flat since June.  The positive shift in market sentiment about oil fundamentals appears to be a crossover from the strength of international gas markets, particularly the sensitivity of markets to a potentially colder-than-normal northern hemisphere winter. Despite mixed weather forecasts, Stanchart says the market may be pricing in lower-than-average temperatures and overstating the boost to oil demand from substitution for gas. In all, significant weather risk appears to be embedded in current prices.nbsp  Comparing medium-term weather forecasts to the colder conditions the market is pricing in, the associated price risk appears to be to the downside.  Biden administration intervenes  With the next OPEC meeting scheduled for 4th October, the big question at this juncture is whether ministers will want to be seen to be doing more to cap prices.  Back in August, Biden exhorted OPEC to do more to control prices at a time when Brent was about USD 8/bbl lower than current levels. That intervention came just after an OPEC meeting and seemed to be primarily intended for a domestic U.S. audience. According to Stanchart, the Biden administration is likely to have repeated this point privately to key producers in advance of the upcoming OPEC meeting and will be expecting more of a response than it got in August when OPEC declined to increase output.  Related Commerce Department Delays Critical Decision On Solar Panel TariffsIndeed, the analysts say therersquos a fair chance that the administration will authorize the release of the strategic oil reserve should OPEC disappoint again and prices continue climbing. In August, for the first time in four years, the Energy Department authorized the release of some of its strategic oil supply to combat a significant fuel shortage in Louisiana following Hurricane Ida.  Rising production  Something else to keep an eye on is rising oil production.  U.S. oil production had been down more than a million bpd over the last couple of weeks, but crude production ticked up for the week ending September 17, to 10.6 million bpndashwith more than 84% of Gulf of Mexico oil producers finally back online after Hurricane Ida made landfall at the end of August.nbsp  The U.S. oil rig count rose by 10 w/w to a 17-month high of 421 for the week ended 24  September, according to the latest Baker-Hughes survey, marking the first consecutive  double-digit increase since April 2017. Four of the 17 Louisiana rigs idled by Hurricane Ida became active again three offshore and one onshore, leaving nine rigs still inactive.  In areas unaffected by Ida, the main w/w gain was Oklahomarsquos four rig increase, taking the statersquos oil rig count to 38.nbsp Within the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the Delaware Basin rig count rose by two, while the Midland Basin rig count fell by one, and other Permian activity was unchanged at 21 rigs.  Meanwhile, Libya remains a wildcard, with Libyarsquos Minister of Oil and Gas, Mohamed Oun, recently announcing that the countryrsquos crude oil production has risen to 1.3mb/d, the highest since April 2013. The Libyan government aims to raise production rapidly, although this will  require investment to upgrade and maintain facilities damaged by war and chronic  underinvestment. Libya remains exempt from OPECquotas, so any increases in production will be additive to OPEClsquos current clip of 400,000 b/d per month.

$200 Oil Traders Are Betting Big On A Global Energy Crunch,2021-09-30T11:00:00-05:00,"Some options traders are betting that oil prices could jump to $200 a barrel by the end of next year as the energy crunch in Europe and Asia shows signs of worsening just ahead of the winter heating season in the northern hemisphere.  Call options at Brent at $200 a barrel for December 2022 traded 1,300 times on Wednesday, according to data from ICE Futures Europe cited by Bloomberg.  Traders would profit from those call options if oil prices were to rally to record levels over the next year.  In recent days, the call options for triple-digit oil prices next year have increased, suggesting that more traders are betting on higher oil prices over the next 12 months.  According to Bloomberg estimates on ICE Futures Europe data, wagers on Brent $100 calls through to the end of 2022 have jumped by 20,000 contracts this month alone.nbsp  Over the past month, the perceived energy supply shortage has led to record gas and power prices in Europe, record spot liquefied natural gas LNG prices in Asia for this time of the year, and multi-year high coal prices in Europe and Asia.  Investment banks revised up their oil price forecasts for the end of the year, although some started to warn that at $80 oil or higher, demand destruction is just a matter of time.  Earlier this month, one of Japanrsquos leading banks, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group MUFG, said that Brent Crude prices were set to retreat to $64 a barrel by the end of 2021, while the energy minister of Oman warned that the International Energy Agencyrsquos suggestion of no new investments in oil could push oil prices to $200 a barrel.  Bank of America said that oil prices could hit $100 per barrel over the next six months if we have a colder-than-usual winter, which could be the most important driver of global energy markets in the coming months.

Oil Prices Top $80 Per Barrel For First Time In 3 Years,2021-09-28T08:30:00-05:00,"Oil prices rose early on Tuesday, with Brent Crude topping $80 a barrel for the first time in three years as the natural gas shortage and price spikes spill over into the crude oil futures market.  As of 709 a.m. EDT, the international benchmark, Brent Crude, traded up by 0.62% at $80.02mdashthe highest level since October 2018.  The U.S. benchmark, WTI Crude, was above $76 per barrel, rising by 0.87% at $76.14mdashthe highest level since early July.  Energy commodities have rallied in recent days after the natural gas shortage in Europe went global with a ripple effect on gas, coal, and crude oil prices. The record-high natural gas and power prices in Europe are leading to additional demand for coal and oil in the power generation sector. Gas-to-oil switching could further accelerate as we go into the winter heating season in the northern hemisphere.  Last week, liquefied natural gas LNG prices in Asia soared by 10 percent to at least $27 per metric million British thermal units mmBtu, industry sources told Reuters. Despite the record prices for this time of the year, demand is strong in Asia as buyers have little choice amid tight natural gas supplies globally.  The gas crunch in Europe and Asia is also pushing the U.S. benchmark gas price, Henry Hub, higher, at above $6/mmBtu on Tuesday to the highest in over seven years.  Recovering oil demand and an underwhelming supply response, coupled with expected higher oil consumption in a gas-to-oil switch, are tightening the crude market and deepening the backwardation in the futures curvemdasha sign that market participants believe supply will continue to be tight.  ldquoLow stockpiles of most fuels and limited time left to replenish before the peak demand season has left consumers around the world increasingly exposed to a colder than normal winter,rdquo Saxo Bank said in a Tuesday note.  ldquoThe next focus is at what level demand will continue to suffer thereby helping to balance the market,rdquo the bankrsquos strategy team added.

Goldman Sachs Hikes Oil Price Forecast To $90,2021-09-27T10:00:00-05:00,"Tightening oil markets with robust demand recovery and disruptions to supply from Hurricane Ida prompted Goldman Sachs to hike its end-2021 oil price forecast to $90 a barrel Brent from $80 per barrel expected earlier.  Goldman Sachs has been saying for months that it sees Brent Crude prices at $80 by the end of this year due to demand recovery and still weaker supply response from non-OPEC oil producers.  Last week, the investment bank said that a colder winter and soaring natural gas prices globally could lead to higher-than-expected oil prices at the end of this year, with the potential for oil hitting $85 per barrel in the fourth quarter.  A week ago, Goldman, which had a price forecast of $80 a barrel oil for the last quarter of 2021, believed that the natural gas crunch combined with a colder-than-usual winter in Europe and Asia could pose an upside risk of $5 a barrel to its Q4 price projection.  With the diminishing impact of the Delta variant on demand and the upside risk from surging global energy prices, Goldman is now raising its year-end oil price forecast to $90 per barrel.  ldquoWhile we have long held a bullish oil view, the current global supply-demand deficit is larger than we expected, with the recovery in global demand from the Delta impact even faster than our above-consensus forecast and with global supply remaining short of our below consensus forecasts,rdquo Goldman analysts wrote in a note dated Sunday and carried by Reuters.    On the supply side, the shut-in production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico amid Hurricane Ida has offset the rise in OPEC supply since July, while supply growth from producers outside the pact has been below expectations, according to Goldman Sachs.  On the other hand, the global gas shortage ahead of the winter will boost demand for oil-fired electricity generation, the investment bank said.  Goldman Sachsrsquo Jeff Currie Brent said last week that oil could reach $90 per barrel if the weather in the northern hemisphere turns out to be colder than normal this winter.  Early on Monday, oil prices were rising by 1 percent, with Brent trading above $79 a barrel and WTI Crude at $75.

Oil Prices Near $80 On Tight Global Supply,2021-09-27T09:00:00-05:00,"Oil prices rose early on Monday, extending Fridayrsquos gains, with Brent nearing $80 and WTI Crude exceeding $75 per barrel as global oil and energy markets continue to tighten.  As of 759 a.m. EDT on Monday, Brent Crude was up by 1.40% at $79.24, and the U.S. benchmark, WTI Crude, traded at $75.02, up by 1.41% on the day, as supply tightens and global energy prices rally ahead of the winter season in the northern hemisphere.  Oil demand is recovering from the Delta variant faster than expected, but supply is not catching up fast enough, analysts say.  Goldman Sachs, for example, said that the deficit in the oil market is now higher than previously expected. The investment bank raised on Sunday its end-2021 oil price forecast to $90 a barrel Brent from $80 per barrel expected earlier, due to robust demand recovery and weaker supply response from OPEC and non-OPEC producers, some of which, like the U.S., were hit by supply disruptions in the wake of Hurricane Ida.  The hurricane has shut in more than 30 million barrels of oil since it made landfall at the end of August, prompting inventory draws in the United States that have underpinned oil prices in recent days.  In addition, surging natural gas prices globally amid decade-low inventory levels in Europe and strong Asian LNG demand ahead of the winter are forcing utilities to run more oil- and coal-fired electricity generation. Increased use of oil in the winter is set to further boost demand for crude alongside the faster-than-expected recovery from the Delta-led slump in consumption in some areas in Asia in July and August.  Oil continues to trade higher ldquoas the global energy crunch that started in the gas, coal and power market has spread to crude oil as users around the world start to switch fuels,rdquo Saxo Bankrsquos strategy team said early on Monday.  ldquoTogether with a vaccine-led rise in demand, Hurricane Ida related supply disruptions, and OPEC not being able to deliver the promised production increases, these developments are likely to underpin prices into the northern hemisphere winter,rdquo the bank said.

The Case For $50 Oil,2021-09-26T18:00:00-05:00,"The oil markets appear to have successfully scaled a major wall of worry, with oil prices rebounding to multi-year highs. Brent crude settled near a three-year high at $77.25/bbl, its best level since October 2018, while WTI closed Thursday trading at $73.30/bbl, scoring the highest settlement since July.  Behind the bullishness is growing optimism that looming debt trouble at China Evergrande Group OTCPKEGRNF OTCPKEGRNY can be contained, coupled with a lack of any hawkish surprises by the Federal Reserve. The Fed recently announced its tapering intention, thereby confirming its economic optimism. Oil demand is seen growing steadily amid an ongoing economic recovery while the supply outlook remains stable thanks to production discipline by OPEC.  Meanwhile, adding to the bullishness is the latest EIA report that shows that U.S. crude stockpiles declined for a seventh consecutive week. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, U.S. crude inventories last week fell by 3.5M barrels to 414M barrels, the lowest level since October 2018. The EIA report was bullish overall, saying supplies will only get worse in the coming weeks due to stretched inventories and the fact that refiners are coming on back faster than the supply of crude oil is growing.  But another Wall Street bear is warning the oil bulls not to do a victory lap just yet.  In a recent tweet, Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone says several commodities, including crude oil, may have peaked and could be poised for a reversion to the mean, i.e., a major pullback.  Iterations for an enduring commodity peak are growing, and the stock market may be the final support pillar. U.S. Treasury bond yields topped out in March. Copper, corn, and lumber peaked in May. The dollar has recovered since June and crude oil may have reached its apex in July, when China cut its required reserve ratio.    Reversion to the mean  McGlone notes that commodities have become highly dependent on rising equities, and says a stock-market stress test is necessary to determine which commodities are the most likely to sustain higher prices and which are due for a pullback.  Unfortunately, he says oil, copper, corn, and lumber belong to the latter category.  McGlone notes that the last two major declines in crude 2018 and 2020 were almost tick-for-tick with the SampP 500. The 20-quarter correlation between the Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index and the SampP 500 currently sits at 0.90, the highest reading since 1960. The BI analyst says the last time the correlation peaked was back in 2013, which was followed by the spectacular oil price crash of 2014, which then spread to the rest of the commodities complex.  Now, there is a risk of WTI reverting back to its mean since 2014, which would mean a drop to around $50 a barrel, McGlone reckons.  McGlone says there's another bearish catalyst working against oil prices Supply elasticity due to technological advancement.  Five years ago, it cost about $50 to extract a barrel of shale crude, now it's closer to $30. Businesses have adjusted to Covid-19, as evidenced in our chart showing SampP 500 Ebit at a record high. If equity prices fall or earnings stall, the highly correlated commodity market risks a drop with greater velocity, McGlone wrote.  Skimming stones  Bloomberg Intelligence is not the only technical analyst who is bearish about the oil price outlook.  Last month, Standard Chartered Global Research described the current oil price cycle as a 'skimming stones' period of trading.nbsp  The research outfit noted that the broad pattern over the past three months has been one of sub-cycles of rallies from starting points below USD 68/bbl for Brent, followed by reversals. Unfortunately for the bulls, the cycles have been getting flatter and faster, with Stanchart saying the next move is likely to be to the downside.  Related Oil Trading Giant Trafigura Sees $100 Oil In Late 2022  According to Stanchart, the first skimming stones sub-cycle started in late-May, culminating in a Brent high of $77.84/bbl six weeks later. The next sub-cycle started below $68/bbl on 20 July with a high of $76.38/bbl two weeks later.nbsp  On the charts, this pattern looks like skimming stones with each bounce less high than the previous one and the length between bounces gradually diminishing.  Stanchart has predicted that the end of the skimming stones phase willnbspinvolve a period of consolidation followed by a breakout move towards the downside.  Stanchart says that whereas the possibility of the oil markets returning to range-bound conditions remains, the current momentum in fundamentals, particularly the surge on the spread of the delta variant, makes an eventual downside breakout more likely.nbsp  Stanchart researchers have strongly refuted Wall Street's bullish positions saying that WTI price of $65/bbl or lower is more likely than $75/bbl or higher. Stanchart says its bearish view is informed by the fact that ...a significant amount of money has already entered the market in the Wall Street-generated belief mistaken according to our analysis that the balances are much tighter and justify USD 80-100/bbl.  Well, at this juncture, we are more concerned about Fed policy.  With the Fed set to start paring bond purchases as soon as November and hike interest rates in response to rising inflation, the dollar appears poised for an upward trajectory, which could be bad news for oil prices and other commodities.

Oil Prices Set For Another Weekly Gain As Supply Tightens,2021-09-24T10:00:00-05:00,"Oil prices were slightly up early on Friday, headed to a third straight week of gains, as U.S. crude inventories dropped to a three-year low and as surging natural gas prices are set to boost demand for alternative fuels.  As of 1010 a.m. EDT, WTI Crude traded above $73 a barrel, at $73.52, up by 0.35%. Brent Crude prices were above $77 per barrel, having risen by 0.47% at $77.58.  Both benchmarks held close to the two-month high they hit on Thursday after U.S. crude stocks dropped to their lowest since October 2018, and the broader market received more clarity about the Fedrsquos next policy moves.  After the Fednbspsignalednbspon Wednesday that it could begin tapering asset purchases as soon as November and potentially start raising interest rates as soon as next year, oil market participants turned their focus to global oil inventories, especially those in the United States.  In addition, the aftermath of Hurricane Ida is still curtailing U.S. oil production, with 16 percent of crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico still offline as of Thursday, according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement BSEE.  On the bearish corner this week, the Evergrande crisis in China that could lead to an implosion of the Chinese property market has capped oil price gains.    However, soaring natural gas prices are set to boost demand for oil because of fuel switching away from gas, analysts and OPEC say.  ldquoIncreased fuel consumption into the northern hemisphere winter due to the substitution of punitively expensive gas may further boost already recovering global demand,rdquo Ole Hansen, Head of Commodity Strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a weekly note on Friday.  ldquoIn addition, recent months have shown some OPEC members, most noticeably Nigeria, Angola and Kazakhstan have struggled to reach their production quota, thereby adding to the underlying market strength, through lower than expected supply,rdquo Hansen added.  From a technical viewpoint, the daily Brent chart shows resistance at the $77.84 a barrel high from July. But ldquothe monthly Brent chart is now showing a break above the downtrend from the 2008 record high, potentially a sign of more gains to follow,rdquo he added. nbsp  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com",-1,0.5324,"[' ', 'oil', '$', 'prices', 'gas', 'market', 'gains', 'U.S.', 'crude', 'boost', 'demand']"
World's Largest Oil Trader Sees Oil Topping $80 By Year-End,2021-09-24T09:00:00-05:00,"Crude oil prices could rise to $80 per barrel by the end of this year and even top it, Vitol Grouprsquos chief executive Russell Hardy told Bloomberg in an interview.  According to Hardy, the gas supply crunch will spur demand for alternatives, lifting crude oil demand up by an additional half a million barrels daily in the fourth quarter. This, in turn, could motivate a higher supply increase on the part of OPEC, the executive also said.  ldquoCan demand surprise us to the upside because of power switching Yes,rdquo Vitolrsquos CEO said. ldquoIs it likely that therersquos half a million barrels a day of extra demand that comes through because of gas pricing Probably our view is, that is likely across winter.rdquo  ldquoAll people are worried about is that wersquore missing pieces of stock which we normally have,rdquo he also told Bloomberg. ldquoDuring the winter, demand for gas is massively higher than demand for gas during the summer. You have to store, therersquos no two ways around it.rdquo  Yet now that Europersquos stored gas appears to be short while demand remains high, a switch to another fuel is the most logical path as solar and wind fall short of demand due to the weather.  Hardyrsquos comments come on the heels of another couple of bullish predictions for the price of oil. Goldman Sachs yesterday said that Brent crude could reach $90 per barrel this winter if it turns out to be a cold rather than a mild one. If it is a cold one, it could lead to 900,000 bpd in additional crude demand, Goldmanrsquos head of commodities, Jeffrey Currie, said.  According to Vitol peer Trafigura, furthermore, oil is set to continue rising next year as well. The chief economist of the commodity trading major said that Brent could jump to $100 by the end of 2022, driven by the continued recovery in global demand.  ldquoNot just the price, but the level of backwardation we are seeing is telling us the market is hungry for oil,rdquo Saad Rahim said during the virtual Argus Asia-Pacific Crude Forum on Thursday.  Oil demand worldwide has recovered enough from the coronavirus and the variants this year to put the oil market in a ldquomuch healthier place,rdquo Rahim said. nbsp  By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com",-1,-0.93,"['demand', ' ', 'said', 'oil', 'gas', 'rdquo', '$', 'year', 'crude', 'Crude', 'barrel']"
Oil Trading Giant Trafigura Sees $100 Oil In Late 2022,2021-09-23T12:00:00-05:00,"Recovering global oil demand could send oil prices to $100 a barrel at some point at the end of 2022, despite COVID challenges to demand this coming winter, according to one of the worldrsquos largest independent oil traders, Trafigura.  ldquoNot just the price, but the level of backwardation we are seeing is telling us the market is hungry for oil,rdquo Saad Rahim, chief economist at Trafigura, said during the virtual Argus Asia-Pacific Crude Forum on Thursday, as carried by Argus.  Oil demand worldwide has recovered enough from the coronavirus and the variants this year to put the oil market in a ldquomuch healthier place,rdquo Rahim said. nbsp  We could see $100 oil next year, probably at the back end, ldquoif conditions are right,rdquo Trafigurarsquos chief economist said at the Argus forum.  In the middle of this year, before the Delta variant hit the U.S. and economies in Asia and Europe, the worldrsquos largest commodity trading groups, including Trafigura, said they would not rule out crude oil prices hitting $100 a barrel.nbsp  Although oil may not be headed to a new supercycle, prices still have room to rise from current levels because of a strong demand rebound and expected tightness in supply, top executives at the commodity traders told the FT Commodities Global Summitnbspin June.  There is a chance for $100 oil, Jeremy Weir, chief executive officer at Trafigura, said back then.  ldquoYou need higher prices to incentivizehellip and also maybe to build on the cost of carbon in the future as well. You also need to attract capital in the business,rdquo Weir told the online debate.  Trafigurarsquos Rahim now says that oil at $100 continues to be a distinct possibility if conditions are right.  Market conditions are pointing to demand recovery. The volume of floating stocks globally has normalized, and U.S. inventories are below the five-year average, Rahim told the Argus forum.  U.S. inventories of crude oil and the most used refined oil products have now fallen to below the 2018 levels, energy research service HFI Research estimated last week.

Goldman Sachs Here's How Oil Prices Could Reach $90 This Winter,2021-09-22T12:45:00-05:00,"Brent could reach $90 per barrel if the weather in the northern hemisphere turns out to be colder than normal this winter, Goldman Sachsrsquo Jeff Currie said on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg.  This is $10 per barrel more than Goldmanrsquos current forecast.  The call for higher oil prices would come on top of the already too-high natural gas prices, which have sunk some natural gas power providers in Europe.  The natural gas situation in Europe will have a spillover effect on the oil market, with natural gas in short supply and crude oil one of the only viable alternatives as wind and solar power prove insufficient at this time.  On Tuesday, commodity trader Vitol said that weather was the key to stopping the panic that currently exists in the marketmdashwith warmer winter weather the only hope for falling prices.  Unfortunately for power consumers and utilities that are already under the gun, but perhaps conveniently for OPEC and the oil industry in general, The Farmersrsquo Almanac is predicting a frosty flip-flop winter in the United States, with lots of whipsawing, with wintery weather spilling over into the end of March.  But a colder winter in Europe in Asia will have a profound effect on natural gas and oil demand. Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs predicted that a colder winter could lead to 900,000 bpd in additional oil demand.    Meanwhile, oil prices were trading roughly 2% on Wednesday, with WTI trading at $71.93 per barrel, and Brent crude trading at $75.83 per barrelmdashup $1.47 on the day. The price rise comes as crude oil inventories continue to draw down in the United States.  Dwindling inventories and projections for increased demand could add to todayrsquos bullish sentiment for crude.

Deutsche Bank Bucks Bullish Oil Predictions,2021-12-01T12:00:00-06:00,"Deutsche Bank expects crude oil prices to drop considerably next year, dipping below $60 per barrel in New York, the bank said in a note.  It would be misguided to think of an OPEC pause on Thursday as bullish, since we have assumed that in our model and still end up with a surplus in Q1,nbspthe Deutsche analysts said, as quoted by Bloomberg. We would be sellers of a rally in crude on the back of an OPEC pause, they also said.  Most other banks are forecasting higher prices for crude oil JP Morgan analysts recently forecast Brent crude reaching $125 per barrel in 2022 and rising further to $150 in 2023.  OPEC is not immune to the impacts of underinvestmenthellip. We estimate 'true' OPEC spare capacity in 2022 will be about 2 million barrels per day 43% below consensus estimates of 4.8 million, the team, led by Christyan Malek, wrote in a note.  The JP Morgan analysts don't appear to be expecting a surplus in global oil supply even in the first quarter of next year. Instead, they are noting that OPEC might need to add a few more installments of 400,000 bpd monthly to bring the market closer to balance.  Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, earlier this week slashed its oil price forecast on the latest Covid-19 scare caused by the emergence of the highly mutated omicron variant. The bank previously forecasted that Brent will trade at an average of $95 per barrel in the first quarter of 2022mdashbut now this has been revised down to $82.50 per barrel.  According to a note by the investment bank's analysts, the oil market appears to be pricing in slower global demand due to the new variant, as well as continued concerns that the balance on the market would tip into a surplus as soon as the first quarter of 2022.

Oil Rebounds On Tight Global Energy Supply,2021-09-21T09:15:00-05:00,"Oil prices rose early on Tuesday, halting two consecutive days of losses as the global natural gas crunch has the market evaluating the potential of higher demand for other fuels in the upcoming winter season.  As of 953 a.m. EDT, WTI Crude was trading up 0.51% at $70.58. Brent Crude prices were rising by 0.47% at $74.28.  The surging natural gas prices in Europe just ahead of the winter heating season raise the potential for switching from gas to oil, analysts say.  ldquoThese higher gas prices should offer some support to the oil market, with the growing potential for gas to oil switching,rdquo ING strategists Warren Patterson and Wenyu Yao said on Tuesday.  In addition, while most of the Gulf of Mexico oil production is now back online after Hurricane Ida, Shell said on Monday that its West Delta-143 WD-143 offshore facilities had sustained ldquosignificant structural damagerdquo from the storm.  Shell estimates that the WD-143 ldquoArdquo platform facilities will be offline for repairs until the end of this year, and that the facilities on the WD-143 ldquoCrdquo platform will be operational in the fourth quarter of 2021. The supermajor expects to resume production from the Olympus platform, which flows across the WD-143 ldquoCrdquo platform, in Q4 2021, and from the Mars and Ursa facilities, which flow across the WD-143 ldquoArdquo platform, in Q1 2022.  The slow return of some of Shellrsquos production in the Gulf of Mexico and the rising energy prices globally supported oil prices early on Tuesday, following a drop on Monday, driven by a stronger U.S. dollar and a broader market sell-off ahead of Fedrsquos policy meeting this week and amid concerns about Chinarsquos economy.  Oil prices bounced overnight, supported for now by ldquoimproved risk sentiment, and more importantly the global energy crunch currently unfolding in the natural gas market, a development that is likely to drive increased demand for fuel products as substitution,rdquo Saxo Bankrsquos strategy team said in a note on Tuesday.

Oil Prices Fall As Traders Anxiously Await Fed's Decision,2021-09-20T09:25:00-05:00,"Oil prices dropped early on Monday as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen ahead of the Fedrsquos much-anticipated policy meeting this week, which could announce the beginning of stimulus easing.  As of 905 a.m. EDT, WTI Crude was losing 1.75% at $70.71 and Brent Crude prices were down 1.49% at $74.21.  The oil market is down for a second consecutive day after Fridayrsquos session settled in the red, as broader markets are anxiously watching whether the Federal Reserve will announce the start of asset purchase tapering at its meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday. The U.S. dollar gains were depressing the oil market as a stronger greenback makes oil buying more expensive for holders of other currencies.  The risk to U.S. oil production in the Gulf of Mexico is now diminishing as more output is being restored in the wake of Hurricane Ida. The return of more production from the U.S. offshore also weighed on oil prices early on Monday.  ldquoAs this week starts, much of the US market tightening on account of Ida is already baked into prices, while outages in offshore oil production and Louisiana refining capacity are continuing to ease,rdquo Vanda Insights said in a note early on Monday.  The U.S. dollar and the Fed meeting will be the key external factors that will determine oilrsquos direction this week, apart from the usual U.S. inventory reports by the API and EIA, ING strategists Warren Patterson and Wenyu Yao say.    ldquoAll eyes will be on the FOMC meeting on Wednesday, where some believe we could already see the Fed announce its intentions to start tapering asset purchases, though our US economist is of the view that an announcement is more likely in November. A tapering announcement this week would likely put some downward pressure on oil and the broader commodities complex,rdquo they noted.  ldquoLast week the rally was halted at $76, the July 29 high, and more importantly it has raised the question whether current and improving fundamentals are strong enough to warrant a push above trendline resistance from the 2008 record peak, currently at $77,rdquo Saxo Bankrsquos strategy team said in a Monday note.  ldquoWe donrsquot believe they are, therefore, leaving the market at risk of a short-term pull back, initially towards the 21-day moving average $72.75,rdquo they added.

Goldman Oil Could Hit $85 In The Fourth Quarter,2021-09-20T09:00:00-05:00,"A colder winter and soaring natural gas prices globally could lead to higher-than-expected oil prices at the end of this year, with the potential for oil hitting $85 per barrel in the fourth quarter, Goldman Sachs says.  Goldman, which has a price forecast of $80 a barrel oil for the last quarter of 2021, believes that the natural gas crunch combined with a colder-than-usual winter in Europe and Asia could pose an upside risk of $5 a barrel to its Q4 price projection, the bankrsquos analysts said in a note on Sunday carried by Reuters.  ldquoThe tightness in global gas supplies creates a clear and potentially meaningful bullish catalyst for the oil market this winter, larger than the downside risk to global oil demand from another Delta-like COVID wave,rdquo the analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote.    According to the investment bank, oil demand could jump by 900,000 barrels per day bpd if the coming winter is colder than usual in the northern hemisphere.  Europersquos tight gas market, low wind speeds, abnormally low gas inventories, and record carbon prices have combined in recent weeks to send benchmark gas prices on the continent and power prices in the largest economies tonbsprecord highs. Record European natural gas prices are sending Asian spot prices of liquefied natural gas LNG to record levels for this time of the year, too.  Last week, Bank of America Global Research said that oil prices could hit $100 per barrel over the next six months if we have a colder-than-usual winter, which could be the most important driver of global energy markets in the coming months. BofA sees upside for oil prices amid modest market deficits in the next few months. It also sees potential for oil to hit $100 a barrel earlier than its mid-2022 call from June if the winter is colder than normal. nbsp  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com",1,0.8313,"['prices', 'oil', 'gas', 'winter', 'colder', '$', 'barrel', ' ', 'natural', 'Goldman', 'usual']"
