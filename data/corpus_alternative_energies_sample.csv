Could Greenflation Derail The Commodity Supercycle,2021-11-30T16:00:00-06:00,"The energy transition is in full swing, with the energy transition driving the next commodity supercycle. This portends immense prospects for metals producers, technology manufacturers, and energy traders and investors.  Indeed, new energy research provider BloombergNEF estimates that the global transition will require $173 trillion in energy supply and infrastructure investment over the next three decades, with renewable energy expected to provide 85% of our energy needs by 2050.  For instance, BNEF projects that by 2030, consumption of lithium and nickel by the battery sector will be at least 5x current levels. Meanwhile, demand for cobalt, used in many battery types, will jump by about 70%. Diverse EV and battery commodities such as copper, manganese, iron, phosphorus, and graphite--all of which are needed in clean energy technologies and are required to expand electricity grids--will see sharp spikes in demand.nbsp  But therein lies a big problem Rising prices of the commodities needed for renewable energy are increasing the costs of setting up new green power projects, which could dramatically slow down the pace of the transition.nbsp  Vaibhav Chaturvedi, fellow at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water CEEW, has conceded that greenflation, or the costs associated with going green, has become a serious concernnbsp Underlying commodity prices are rising everywhere in the world, he has said.  Rising costs  This trend is problematic for one big reason Falling costs have been a major driving force of the clean energy boom.  Over the past decade, the price of solar electricity dropped 89%, while the price of onshore wind dropped 70%.  Meanwhile, rapidly falling EV battery prices have played a big role in helping electric vehicles become more mainstream. As per Bloomberg, over the past decade, EV battery prices have fallen from almost $1,200 per kilowatt-hour to just $137/kWh in 2020. For an EV with a 50 kWh battery pack, that adds up to savings of more than $43,000 in real terms.  Related The Electric Vehicle Charging Market Could Be Worth As Much As $1.6 Trillion  Overall, clean energy has actually reached an economic tipping point A 2019 report from the nonprofit Rocky Mountain Institute found that it was cheaper to build and use a combination of renewables like wind and solar than to build new natural gas plants. Another 2020 report from Carbon Tracker found that in every single one of the world's energy markets, it's cheaper to invest in renewables than in coal.  But this remarkable trend has now gone into reverse gear, with prices of metals such as tin, aluminum, copper, nickel, and cobalt, which are essential to energy transition technologies, climbing between 20% and 90% this year, thanks to massive global supply chain disruptions.  Big Leverage  However, the experts are saying that rising green energy costs are only a short-term problem that will be counteracted by another friendlier trend Falling costs of funding.  According to Chaturvedi, declining costs of funding for renewable projects will act as a big leverage that will counter the increase in underlying costsndashand he is not alone.  Gauri Singh, deputy director-general at the International Renewable Energy Agency IRENA, has argued that despite ongoing inflation and supply chain disruptions, decreasing financing costs helped generate a record 260 gigawatts of energy from renewable sources in 2020.  You will not actually get cheap money for anything that's a climate risk. Whereas for renewables, the market is softening, Singh has declared.  These experts seem to be supported by solid researchnbsp Allied Market Research has projected that the global renewable energy market will grow from $881 billion euro781 billion in 2020 to nearly $2 trillion euro1.8 trillion by 2030.  And, metals have been tipped to become the oil of the future.  Clean energy technologies require more metals than their fossil fuel-based counterparts. According to a recent Eurasia Review analysis,nbsp prices for copper, nickel, cobalt, and lithium could reach historical peaks for an unprecedented, sustained period in a net-zero emissions scenario, with the total value of production rising more than four-fold for the period 2021-2040, and even rivaling the total value of crude oil production.  Related Green Fintech Is A New Trend Investors Canrsquot IgnoreThere's a big negative for the fossil fuel sector--Bloomberg New Energy Finance BNEF has forecast that electric and fuel cell vehicles will displace 21 million barrels per day in oil demand by 2050.  In the net-zero emissions scenario, the metals demand boom could lead to a more than fourfold increase in the value of metals productionndashtotaling $13 trillion accumulated over the next two decades for the four metals alone. This could rival the estimated value of oil production in a net-zero emissions scenario over that same period, making the four metals macro-relevant for inflation, trade, and output, and providing significant windfalls to commodity producers.nbspnbsp  For instance, BNEF estimates that it takes 10,252 tons of aluminum, 3,380 tons of polysilicon, and 18.5 tons of silver to manufacture solar panels with 1GW capacity. With global installed solar capacity expected to double by 2025 and quadruple to 3,000 GW by 2030, the solar industry is expected to become a significant consumer of these commodities over the next decade. The new energy research outfit also estimates that it takes 154,352 tons of steel, 2,866 tons of copper, and 387 tons of aluminum to construct wind turbines and infrastructure with the power capacity of a gigawatt. The Global Wind Energy Outlook GWEO has forecast installed wind capacity to hit 2,110GW by 2030, representing a 185% growth over the timeframe.  Meanwhile, BNEF also estimates that it takes 1,731 tons of copper, 1,202 tons of aluminum, and 729 tons of lithium to manufacture 1GWh Li-ion batteries.  Overall, greenflation is likely to end up as a temporary speed bump rather than a long-term challenge to the green energy megatrend.

Southeast Asia Needs $2 Trillion To Realize Its Green Economy Ambitions,2021-10-07T14:00:00-05:00,"Investing $2 trillion over the next decade in sustainable infrastructure can greatly reduce Southeast Asiarsquos greenhouse gas emissions, according to a new report from Bain amp Company, Microsoft and Singaporersquos Temasek Holdings.  The report, titled ldquoSoutheast Asiarsquos Green Economy Opportunities on the Road to Net Zero,rdquo emphasized investments in areas such as renewable energy, electric vehicles, and waste management.  According to the report, green investments totaled only U.S. $9 billion last year. The reportrsquos authors said Southeast Asiarsquos corporate, public, and philanthropic sectors must work together to attain the $2 trillion investment figure, the report noted.  Southeast Asia is highly vulnerable to climate change, as it suffers from disproportionately large numbers of climate disasters.  Road to net-zero  Though fighting COVID-19 currently remains a high priority for most governments, a lot of attention in Southeast Asia last year went to climate actions and thinking about what entails a green economy, according to Dale Hardcastle, co-director of Bainrsquos global sustainability innovation center.  The report found that about 90% of Southeast Asiarsquos carbon emissions can be addressed by transitioning away from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources like wind and solar, valuing nature and making the regionrsquos agricultural production of food more efficient.    ldquoWhile we are seeing many encouraging changes in Southeast Asiarsquos Green Economy and the overall trend is positive, there is still much more to be done,rdquo said Dale Hardcastle, a partner in Bain amp Companyrsquos Singapore office and co-director of the firmrsquos Global Sustainability Innovation Center GSIC. ldquoSoutheast Asia presents specific conditions which provide both challenges and opportunities for a full-scale sustainability transformation. The region needs to act now and take three steps to translate these opportunities into tangible results define its road to Net Zero, catalyze the journey and outcomes together, and unlock capital flows.rdquo  Achieving net-zero as a region demands individual action by businesses, investors, governments, and communities, as well as collective action at an ecosystem level.  CNBCrsquos ldquoStreet Signs Asiardquo interviewed Hardcastle as part of the climate conference Ecosperity. Hardcastle said governments are beginning to look at cross-regional cooperation more often, whether itrsquos examining green finance, energy transition or other issues.  Ingredients for collective action  According to the report, three ingredients are crucial for collective action.  Firstly, the report cited ldquoecosystem-wide co-innovation.rdquo That would ldquoaccelerate commercialization of low-carbon tech that suits SEArsquos needs, such as agri-tech and carbon capture increase sharing of data/tools/standards through value chain-wide alliances and mobilize public and private capital to conserve and restore SEArsquos natural carbon sinks.rdquo  Furthermore, ldquocollective transition support, leveraging public-private partnerships and blended financingrdquo will help improve ldquoaccess to capital and build capabilities of SMEs/smallholders, mitigate impact of stranded assets for hard-to-abate sectors, and upskill and retrain SEArsquos workforce for the green economy.rdquo  Lastly, the report emphasized the importance of regional collaboration. Within that, the report cited the importance of developing a ldquoholistic SEA Net Zero transition plan,rdquo establishing a cross-border carbon trading system, and reassessing ldquoenergy security by exploring a regional grid to more efficiently connect demand to supply.rdquo  By AG Metal Minernbsp  More Top Reads from Oilprice.com    A Very Predictable Global Energy Crisis  The Real Reason OPEC Refused To Boost Production Further  Natural Gas Stocks To Watch As The Energy Crisis Goes Global",1,0.9929,"[' ', 'report', 'Southeast', 'Asiarsquos', 'carbon', 'green', 'climate', 'Hardcastle', 'action', '$', 'Net']"
IEA Chief Don't Blame Renewables For Europe's Energy Crunch,2021-09-28T11:00:00-05:00,"The energy squeeze in Europe has nothing to do with the continent's energy transition plans, the head of the International Energy Agency Fatih Birol told the European Parliament's energy and environment committees.  It is inaccurate and unfair to explain these high energy prices as a result of clean energy transition policies. This is wrong, Birol said, as quoted by Reuters. Further, he added that EU governments needed to keep their eyes on reducing global warming, even when times are volatile, referring to the sky-high gas prices in Europe.  The official did not miss the chance to take a stab at Russia, either, saying, Some major suppliers are reluctant to send additional gas in these difficult days to Europe and elsewhere, even though in my view it was an opportunity to underscore that they are a reliable supplier,nbspechoing his own earlier remarks that urged Russia to send additional gas volumes to Europe.  Gazprom has insisted that it has fulfilled its contractual obligations to European clients, and no one in Europe is disputing that. However, questions are being asked about Gazprom supplying less gas on the spot market and into its own storage facilities across Europe, which the state giant has explained with the prioritization of filling up its domestic storage.  Meanwhile, European utilities are stocking up on coal in anticipation of lower renewable energy output volumes during the winter, Bloomberg reported, citing Citigroup commodity analysts.  A tight gas market should continue to pull EUA [EU carbon emission permits] prices higher, Citigroup analysts led by Edward Morse said. Furthermore, coal use in Europe is expected to increase through winter, on lower renewables power generation and planned closures of some nuclear power generation capacity.  What's more, Spain has warned the European Union that its energy transition plans may not survive the test of sky-high electricity prices. In a letter, Spain said the EU's efforts to keep emissions in check may not stand a sustained period of abusive electricity prices.

China's Control Over Key Battery Metals Should Worry The U.S.,2021-09-26T12:00:00-05:00,"The writing is on the wall for the fossil fuels industry. For decades, climate scientists and environmental activists have been urging the world to move away from dirty and finite energy sources like coal, oil, and gas and to transition toward renewable energies that have a much lighter impact on the climate and the environment as a whole. While the world has been slow to respond to these escalating pleas for decarbonization, it looks like the global community has finally entered the clean energy transition in earnest.nbsp  Peak oil is just around the corner -- that is, if it isnrsquot already happening as we speak. To be sure, the world is not going to wean itself off of fossil fuels overnight, and hundreds of billions of barrels of oil will be consumed before the petro-economy fades to black. But oilrsquos days as the king of the global energy economy are numbered, and even Big Oil is finally starting to pivot toward a cleaner energy future.nbsp  Indeed, the parts of the energy industry seeing the most growth, innovation, and investment in the current era are centered around renewable energies, from the booming business of energy storage to electric vehicle batteries.  But while these cleaner energy technologies have much lower negative environmental externalities than traditional fossil fuels, renewable energy infrastructure is still dependent on a litany of finite natural resources. Some of the battery metals that figure as key components for manufacturing technologies like photovoltaic solar panels and lithium-ion batteries are likely going to be the geopolitical linchpins of the future, much as oil fields and coal seams have been in the industrial era.nbsp    In fact, we could soon see an all-out renewable energy resource war between key players like the United States and China if trade negotiations and diplomacy arenrsquot handled with care. China currently controls up to 90% of the global supply of battery metals and minerals, and they have already shown that they are not afraid to wield this supply-chain control to bully other nations and sway international relations.nbsp  The global transition from fossil fuels to clean energy could necessitate an inversion of as much as $173 trillion in energy supply and infrastructure investment over the next thirty years, which will ldquoreverberate from lithium-rich salt flats in Chile to polysilicon plants in Chinarsquos Xinjiang regionrdquo according to reporting from Bloomberg. While renewable energies like solar and wind can be installed in virtually any region, in some ways democratizing the playing field for nations who have historically been reliant on energy imports, there will still be major winners and losers in the clean energy game. Indeed, the coming clean energy gold rush is poised to completely shift the geopolitical power map, giving newfound influence to nations naturally rich in these battery metals.nbsp  ldquoThe energy transition is driving the next commodity supercycle,rdquo Jessica Fung, head strategist at Swiss green-mining fund Pala Investments Ltd., was quoted in the Bloomberg report entitled lsquoTherersquos a Fortune to Be Made in the Obscure Metals Behind Clean Powerlsquo. ldquoIt is a decades-long transition, but the time to invest and make money is this decade. The time is now.rdquo  Demand for cobalt is expected to increase by 70% by 2030. Lithium and nickel consumption will increase at least five-fold. And the world is already running out of lithium-ion batteries. Itrsquos not just lithium, silicon, and cobalt that are going gangbusters. In the past few months yellowcake uranium has seen a historic surge in trading and purchases as buyers bet big on nuclear energyrsquos role in the impending decarbonization of the global energy trade. Even Redditrsquos infamous r/WallStreetBets is getting involved.nbsp  Any kind of low-carbon energy production is sure to expand rapidly in the coming decades, and the seismic shift in global supply chains for clean energy infrastructure can not be overstated.

Why Chevron And Exxon Shun Solar And Wind,2021-09-26T16:00:00-05:00,"The world's largest oil companies are under growing pressure from shareholders and society to reduce emissions and show efforts to fight the worst effects of climate change.nbspnbsp  Everyone in the Big Oil club has announced various plans to cut emissions and invest in low-carbon energy over the past 18 months. Yet, there are stark differences in the ways the largest international oil companies are approaching the emissions problem.nbsp  Europe's top oil and gas firms have all committed to becoming net-zero energy businesses by 2050 or sooner. Most of them say their oil production has either peaked already or is about to peak by the middle of this decade. And all of them bet on investments in renewable electricity generationmdashalong with hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, biofuels, and electric vehicle charging networksmdashto deserve being called 'energy companies' instead of oil companies.nbsp  Unlike their European peers, the two supermajors in the United States, ExxonMobil, and Chevron, are not touching solar and wind power. They are more focused on renewable fuels and carbon capture and storage CCS, both to cut their own carbon footprint and to develop in partnership regional CCS hubs at heavily industrialized areas.nbsp  European Oil Majors Bet On Renewables  Together with the net-zero ambitions, all European oil and gas majorsmdashBP, Shell, TotalEnergies, Equinor, Eni, and Repsolmdashvow increased investment in renewable power generation and low-carbon energy solutions such as hydrogen, CCS, and biofuels.nbsp  While hydrogen and CCS still need a lot of development, economies of scale, and major government support to become commercially viable solutions, investment in renewable electricity generation is immediately available for Big Oil.nbsp  If they want it, that is.  Europe's majors seem to want it, and almost weekly, they announce projects, investments, or joint ventures to bid in tenders.nbspnbsp  Returns in renewables are not as high as in oil and gas, especially these days, with oil prices comfortably sitting at over $70 a barrel and gas prices surging to records for this time of the year.nbsp  However, European majors persevere and consider renewables as a key pillar of decarbonization of the global power sector and of reduction of their own emissions from operations.nbsp  For example, Equinor wants to be a big name in offshore wind, and Norway's majornbspbidnbspfor offshore wind acreage in the major ScotWind leasing round earlier this year. So didnbspBPnbspandnbspShell.nbsp  BP's joint venture Lightsource bp, a solar power developer, announced just this week it would aim to develop 25 GW of solar power by 2025. Since its formation in 2010, Lightsource has developed 3.8 GW of solar projects globally.nbspnbspnbsp  Lightsource bp has developed more than 30 projects, which today have consistently delivered 8 to 10% returns. So when people ask if we really have the capability to deliver the returns we talk about, the answer couldn't be clearer ndash yes, we can because we are, said Dev Sanyal, BP's executive vice president of gas and low carbon.nbsp  Exxon, Chevron Shun Solar And Wind  Across the Atlantic, U.S. supermajors Exxon and Chevron are betting on renewable fuels and CCS, but they are steering clear of investments in solar and wind power generation.nbsp  Chevron doesn't have any plans to reduce its oil and gas business to invest in solar or wind power, chief financial officer Pierre Breber said earlier this year.  Shareholder returns are more important for Chevron than investing in wind and solar energy, chief executive Mike WirthnbsptoldnbspCNBC in an interview last week.  These [wind and solar] are technologies that are relatively mature. There is plenty of capital that's available. The returns in wind and solar are actually being bid down, and we've concluded that management in our company can't create value for shareholders by going into wind and solar, Wirthnbsptold CNBC.nbspnbsp  Chevron Triples Planned Low-Carbon Energy Investmentnbsp  Days before the interview, Chevron said it would triple its planned capital investment in lower carbon businesses to $10 billion through 2028, including $2 billion to lower the carbon intensity of Chevron's operations.nbsp  Chevron's pillars of low carbon energy businesses are growing renewable natural gas production, raising renewable fuels production capacity, boosting hydrogen production, and increasing carbon capture and offsets to 25 million tons per year by developing regional hubs in partnership with others.nbsp  With the anticipated strong cash generation of our base business, we expect to grow our dividend, buy back shares and invest in lower carbon businesses, CEO Wirth said.nbsp  ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions ndash Exxon's New Business  Exxon, for its part, created earlier this year a new business, ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions, to commercialize its low-carbon technology portfolio, focusing first on CCS.nbsp  The new business is advancing plans for more than 20 new CCS opportunities globally to enable large-scale emission reductions. ExxonMobil plans to invest $3 billion on lower-emission energy solutions through 2025.nbsp  We are focused on proprietary projects and commercial partnerships that will have a demonstrably positive impact on our own emissions as well as those from the industrial, power generation and commercial transportation sectors, which together account for 80 percent of global CO2 emissions, Exxon's CEO Darren Woods said in February this year.nbsp  Shareholder pressure on Exxon has increased tremendously since then, and so has on Chevron.nbspnbsp  The U.S. supermajors have not pledged any net-zero emission targets, but they are likely to accelerate announcements about investments in lower-carbon energy, which, apparently, will not include solar or wind.nbsp  By Tsvetana Paraskova of Oilprice.com",1,0.9929,"[' ', 'carbon', 'solar', 'oil', 'Chevron', 'wind', 'energy', 'power', 'gas', 'renewable', 'emissions']"
The U.S. Is Set To Break Another Solar Record Despite Rising Costs,2021-09-16T17:00:00-05:00,"New solar power capacity additions in the United States are on track to book a record year despite supply chain disruptions that have seen price spikes that have effectively put an end to the cheap solar narrative.  In the second quarter alone, new solar installations rose 45 percent on the year at a total 5.7 GW of installed capacity in both residential and utility-scale installations, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said in a joint report with the Solar Energy Industries Association. But this record has been marred by rising prices across the industry.  According to Wood Mac, price increases resulting from supply chain disruptions amid the pandemic have affected utility-scale solar installations more strongly than residential installations in what is the first solar cost increase in at least seven years. Data from the study shows turnkey prices for solar installations are currently at levels last seen in 2016.nbsp  The data also shows something else that may potentially be more worrying. The price decline in solar has smoothened out since 2019, suggesting the space for further significant cost reductions may be limited.  This would have important implications for the Biden administrationrsquos energy agenda, which bets heavily on solar. In fact, a study from the Energy Department has suggested the U.S. could generate as much as 45 percent of its electricity from solar farms.  ldquoThe study illuminates the fact that solar, our cheapest and fastest-growing source of clean energy, could produce enough electricity to power all of the homes in the U.S. by 2035 and employ as many as 1.5 million people in the process,rdquo Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in comments on the study. ldquoAchieving this bright future requires a massive and equitable deployment of renewable energy and strong decarbonization policies.rdquo  Related The Major Problem With EVs No One Is Talking About  Indeed, this would require a massive deployment of solar powermdashsome 1,050 to 1,570 GW of solar power, or even 1,600, per the Energy Departmentrsquos study. This is more than the total U.S. generation capacity right now and will be an increase of a staggering 1,450 percent from current capacity, according to one energy technology and policy researcher from the University of Texas.  According to Joshua D. Rhodes, who spoke to The Conversation, boosting U.S. solar capacity from the current 103 GW to more than 1,000 GW is possible, but it will not be easy. A megawatt of solar capacity needs some 8 acres. Based on this, the DoErsquos target capacity would require a land area of between 10.2 and 11.5 million acres or, says Rhodes, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, taken together.  There is already nascent opposition to utility-scale solar projects from conservation activists and other groups. The WSJ earlier this year reported on one such case involving the Battle Born solar project, which will covermdashliterallymdash14 square miles, which is the size of 7,000 football fields, rendering the land useless for other purposes.  If the cost problem persists, which is quite likely given that supply chain analysts expect disruptions to continue into 2022, it would make achieving the DoErsquos solar target all the more difficult. The government has indicated it will fully support strong growth in solar capacity, but this capacity has been touted as super cheap and affordable, with lots of incentives for households and businesses to go solar, too. With higher prices, these incentives might start to ring hollow, and the federal government wonrsquot be able to pay for every added GW.  The ldquobright futurerdquo outlined by Secretary Granholm may be harder to achieve than believed because of these challenges. Developers are already delaying project completions because of the cost increases. If this continues, some projects might get shelved. The Wood Mac and SEIA report notes that government support remains essential, but if we are being realistic just how much support and for how long can the government provide when it is already stretching itself thin with billions planned for one or another energy-related initiative that lack unified support even among Congress Democrats  By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com",1,0.9935,"['solar', ' ', 'capacity', 'energy', 'installations', 'GW', 'study', 'Energy', 'cost', 'U.S.', 'government']"
Democrats Divided On Biden's $3.5 Trillion Green Energy Plan,2021-09-14T10:30:00-05:00,"Divisions are deepening between Democratic Senators over the $3.5 trillion economic recovery plan proposed by the Biden administration, in which an energy system overhaul features heavily.  West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, for one, earlier called for a strategic pause on discussions of the package after openly expressing skepticism about the price tag of the plan.  I have always said if I can't explain it, I can't vote for it, and I can't explain why my Democratic colleagues are rushing to spend $3.5 trillion, Manchin wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal.  Incidentally, as CNN notes, Manchin represents a coal-producing state. And just as openly as he is critical of the price of the Biden plan, Manchin has been against the shift to a 100-percent renewable grid.  But it's not only Manchin, the CNN report notes. The differences within the Democratic Party are running deeper and deeper along pro and anti-fossil fuel lines. Just as Sen. Manchin appears to be adamant that zero fossil fuels make no sense, there are senators at the opposite end of the spectrum who will not vote on the $3.5-trillion bill unless it makes climate change stipulations that satisfy them.    Everyone gets a chance to kick the tires, Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said, as quoted by CNN, in response to Manchin's comments about a 100-percent renewable grid. At the end of the day we are going to have a deal, and it is going to be good enough on climate or it won't go.  The urgency of the crisis was made very clear this summer, Sen. Ed Markey from Massachusetts said. We have to work hard to find a resolution of this issue. But I don't think we should finish the legislation until there is a clean energy standard.  Such differences appear irreconcilable, and the Democrats need total unity to get the monster recovery bill through budget reconciliation. Both sides would need to make concessions if this is to happen, but based on the above comments and others like them, the extent of these concessions may not be sufficient to ensure the success of the bill.By Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com",1,0.9776,"['Manchin', ' ', 'Sen.', 'Democratic', '$', '3.5', 'trillion', 'plan', 'said', 'CNN', 'bill']"
Middle East Oil Producers Make Surprising Pivot Towards Renewables,2021-09-12T18:00:00-05:00,"Weaning the world off hydrocarbons to fight climate change is this generationrsquos biggest challenge. It is a challenge that has pushed major OECD members to adopt far-reaching strategies, such as the EU Green Deal or the UKrsquos future ban on new gasoline-powered cars. Yet demand for oil and gas continues to increase, putting mainstream hydrocarbon-producing countries in the spotlight. This was exemplified last week Iraqrsquos Finance Minister Ali Allawi, called for oil producers to move into renewable energy.  At first glance, this appears contradictory, with Iraq still funding new oil projects. However, looking at the overall regional picture this claim is less surprising. The Gulf is facing up to the stark possibility of an lsquoend to oilrsquo, forcing them to reassess the very basis of their economies. As a result, the first shoots of a Middle Eastern green energy arms race are sprouting, with Iraqrsquos declaration emblematic of this.  The outcome is still unclear, but the immense emphasis put by major oil producers like Saudi Arabia, or the UAE, in growing their slice of the hydrogen cake, is an obvious sign that strategies are changing. Simultaneously, most Gulf countries are investing heavily into home-grown renewable energy sources, particularly solar in this sun-drenched part of the world.  GCC nations are keeping a closer eye on the shifting political opinions vis-a-vis hydrocarbons. The nervous ones are increasingly panicked about the draconian tone adopted against oil and gas. The smart ones see this as an opportunity. A major climate roundtable co-hosted by U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry and his UAE counterpart Dr. Sultan Al Jaber in April showed the apparent willingness at least some in this part of the world demonstrate as they tentatively climb aboard the green energy train.    The direction of travel is clear. Speaking on that trip, Kerry said lsquorsquothe importance of an oil and gas-producing nation [the UAE] bringing together a group of nations that many people might think were improbably committed to dealing with the climate crisisrdquo was an unequivocal signal. Without bringing Arab oil producers on board effective climate action will be significantly hampered and people like Kerry know this.  A major diplomatic effort is underway to convince Gulf states that their long-term interests are best served by helping, not hindering the climate cause. Some appear to be signing up, such as the UAErsquos ambitious bid to host COP28. Iraqrsquos Finance Ministerrsquos recent positive statement on renewables can also be seen as major recognition that fighting against the tide of the green energy transition is a battle OPEC cannot win.  Economically, major issues are still there to be dealt with. OPEC countries donrsquot want to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. However, these golden eggs can and are being used to finance a cleaner future. Middle East green investments are booming. This year, renewable investments have outstripped conventional power projects in the region for the first time ever. KSA is aiming to add 58.7GW of renewable capacity by 2030 and the UAE is aiming to source 44% of power from clean sources by 2050.  These moves will make the GCC the 2nd largest green energy growth region in the world behind only the USA. Enthusiasm should be tempered, given the concerns about the efficiency of major infrastructure projects in the region. However, with the support from state-backed hydrocarbon behemoths like ADNOC and Aramco, these investment shifts will have a lasting impact.  The educated gamble is that the pain of falling oil demand will be offset by a booming, high-tech renewables industry financed by, but increasingly independent of hydrocarbon revenues. The place to start will be removing the high hydrocarbon dependency in local supply. Next will be investing in hydrogen projects, backed up by major solar or even wind energy investments needed for blue hydrogen production. It not only will help to diversify economies, hydrogen can also be produced by using existing hydrocarbon reserves that otherwise could become stranded assets.  Another major driver is to maintain a global power position by becoming a renewables powerhouse. Substitution of its oil power status can be achieved by full-force backing of green energy. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have already indicated moves in this direction with billions invested in clean power projects across the globe. Finance Minister Ali Allawi may see his wish become a reality sooner than he realizes as oil-producing Gulf states increasingly realize that smart money is going green.

The Solar Boom Has A Supply Chain Problem,2021-09-12T14:00:00-05:00,"Grid parity, resilient networks and strategic partnerships have spurred growth in the worldrsquos solar panel manufacturing capacity in recent years, to 330 gigawatts GW in mid-2021. A Rystad Energy analysis reveals that to meet the 1.5degC 2050 scenario under the Paris Agreement, capacity has to quadruple to 1,200-1,400 GW by 2035 to handle the peak installations needed. This will be a challenging task, however, as manufacturers now see their utilization plummet due to rising costs and Covid-19 ndash a turn of events that could discourage the investments needed to expand capacity further.  The aggregated utilization rate for solar modules the difference between manufacturing capacity and shipments was 84% in 2018 and has been decreasing since, to 71% in 2019 and to 58% in 2020, when logistics efficiency and transportation was hampered by the pandemic in most parts of the world. The spread of Covid-19 has created a major economic disruption in the market and is expected to continue to impact utilization rates for most of 2021.  In the short to medium-term it will be challenging to keep solar costs down as prices for some input factors have spiked in the past few months. The cost of solar projects has declined considerably in recent years, but the cost reductions have now started to taper off and move closer to a floor, currently defined by the price of input factors such as labor, polysilicon, silver, copper, aluminum and steel.  Related Hurricanes Raise Risk Of Oil Spills In Gulf Of Mexico  These input factors have seen a clear rise in prices in 2020 and 2021. Mono-polysilicon, the key ingredient in photovoltaic panels, rose from $7.6 per kilogram in 2019 to $9 per kg in 2020, and is likely to average $18 per kg in 2021. The price of silver, which is important for the connections from the silicon cell to copper wires, has climbed from $550 per kg in 2019 to $850 per kg on average in 2021.  The combined effect of all input factors is that global solar panel prices have gone up 16% so far in 2021 from 2020. The weighted price inflation for solar projects, including labor ndash from installation and other equipment to construction work, which accounts for an increasing share of overall costs ndash means that total costs are up 12%, potentially limiting demand growth for the few next years.    ldquoThe entire industry is experiencing shortages in the supply of raw and auxiliary materials, especially polysilicon and silver. Covid-19-related restrictions have not only created supply shortages of essential raw materials, but have also led to higher prices, resulting in fewer shipments and impacting revenues for industry participants,rdquo says Audun Martinsen, Head of Energy Service Research at Rystad Energy.  A reduction in the mineral and metal intensities could be key to increasing the production capacity and addressing the supply chain challenge, Martinsen adds.  In the longer term, the solar industry must increase capacity and continue to fight cost escalation to meet climate change goals. Rystad Energy estimates that to maintain the global temperature increase below 1.5degC, solar panel manufactures should ideally grow 10% annually to meet the needed module production capacity of 1,200-1,400 GW by 2035.  Related Auto Giants Slash Production As Chip Shortage Worsens  In the past, module capacity has grown at a similar rate, however, with the current supply shortages in essential raw materials like polysilicon, silver and glass, and the price hike in auxiliary raw materials, 10% growth would be a very ambitious target for solar companies. In fact, by 2035, the solar PV industry would have to source seven times more silver than what it does today, when it already consumes 10% of global silver production.nbspnbsp  Limiting global warming to 1.7degC instead is a more achievable scenario under the current supply constraints. As there is enough capacity for another eight years, this should give solar companies more time to expand production capacity. To accomplish the 1.7degC scenario, companies should be able to expand production capacity to 1,000-1,200 GW by 2045, while still consuming a large part of silver and polycrystalline, in a time frame that allows supply to adapt.

Are Saudi Arabia's Green Energy Plans Realistic,2021-08-31T18:00:00-05:00,"If words could create reality, Saudi Arabia would probably be on its way to overtake China as the worldrsquos most ambitious energy transition leader. The desert kingdom that produces a tenth of the worldrsquos oil has been vocal about its renewable energy plans.  Yet, it has also been vocal about its oil production plans, which come down to a solid boost of output while the going is good. Because itrsquos getting increasingly uncertain just how long the going will be good for oil.  Earlier this year, as oil prices rebounded from the rout the pandemic had caused in 2020, Saudi Arabia hiked its export prices for its biggestmdashand most valuablemdashclients importers in Asia. This caused a reaction from India, which depends on imports for more than three-quarters of its oil consumption, and this reaction indicated that importers may no longer be willing to buy at any price. The reason this was possible was the availability of alternatives.  Ten years ago, Saudi Arabia was the undisputed leader of OPEC and equally undisputed top oil producer. Now, it shares the leadership of OPEC with Russia, and it competes in the global oil markets with the United States. Earlier this year, the Saudis felt a new pinch in Asia as importers there opted for cheaper Russian and U.S. crude.    So, on the oil front, Saudi Arabia is having to contend with large and strong competitors, which curb its price-setting power on key export markets. Does this mean it would go the Iraq way and seek to boost production and lower prices in a bid to expand its market sharenbsp  That could be one obvious way forward, but it might not be the best one. Riyadh needs its oil revenues. It needs them not just to keep the economy going but also to advance its low-carbon goals.  The Financial Times reported earlier this week that Saudi Arabiarsquos renewable energy plans mostly remained on paper, and it was unclear how the Kingdom plans to transfer them from paper to material reality.  The plans are grandiose the Neon smart citymdashand clean energy hubmdashproject alone has a price tag of $500 billion. Saudi Arabia also has big hydrogen plans a $5-billion green hydrogen production site at Neom. And yet, last year, when the Kingdom had said it would commission 1 GW of new solar capacity, it commissioned zero. Why Because Riyadh tried to renegotiate the price tag of the project with its developer, leaning on dropping solar tariffs in the region.  It is a truism that things tend to be easier said than done, and Saudi Arabiarsquos renewable energy plans seem to be an illustration of its truthfulness. This reluctance could hurt Saudi Arabiarsquos competitiveness in the future if those who say oil demand will peak sooner than previously expected turn out to be right. The argument is that now that much of the world has joined the energy transition drive, the actual transition will accelerate.  There is also a counterargument, and it is that, like in Saudi Arabia, there is a lot more talk than action, even in Europe. And this means oil in general and Saudi oil specifically still has quite a long future ahead of it. If this is true, it is important for the Saudis to play their oil hand carefully.  The Kingdom still pumps the lowest-cost oil in the world. This means it could withstand lower prices if it decides to go for the flood-the-market strategy to claw back market share from rivals. Saudi Arabia could also keep a lid on production, but this will only help its rivals expand their own market share.  Whatever the Kingdom chooses to do, it needs to bring down the hype it is building around its green energy plans and go for something more realistic because hype doesnrsquot build smart cities or plant 10 billion trees oil money does.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com",1,0.9925,"['oil', 'Saudi', ' ', 'plans', 'Arabia', 'energy', 'production', 'prices', 'price', 'market', 'Kingdom']"
Can The U.S. Keep Its Wind Energy Boom Alive,2021-08-30T12:00:00-05:00,"Wind energy holds enormous potential to generate carbon-free electricity around the world, and the energy industry finally seems to be catching on. Last year the United States broke records for wind energy installation, and it looks like the wind revolution is just getting started.  While current global wind power capacity is capable of generating just a fraction of the world's energy demand, wind powerrsquos technical potential actually exceeds worldwide energy production. The technical potential of a renewable energy technology is the amount of energy generation that is theoretically achievable once system performance, topographic, environmental, and land-use constraints are accounted for. And even when taking all of these constraints into consideration, wind energy alone would be capable of filling the entire worldrsquos energy needs. In order to actually make that happen, though, massive scaling of both on- and offshore wind farms would be necessary -- and that kind of scaling is not without its drawbacks.  Other than initial cost, which could be a barrier to entry but which is decreasing all the time thanks to technological improvements and economies of scale, large-scale wind projects pose potential negative environmental and social externalities. Wildlife, such as bird and bat collisions on-shore and marine life offshore, must be considered. In terms of social impact, wind farms alter landscapes, block views, and can cause potential radar interference. These negative impacts, however, pale in comparison to the benefits of wind power, not to mention the negative externalities of global warming.  According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC, the energy used and greenhouse gases emitted in the life cycle of a wind turbine, from manufacturing to decommissioning, are puny in comparison to the energy generated and emissions mitigated over the apparatusrsquo lifetime. ldquothe GHG emissions intensity of wind energy is estimated to range from 8 to 20 g CO2 /kWh in most instances, whereas energy payback times are between 3.4 to 8.5 months,rdquo a 2018 report stated.nbsp  Related Oil Could Be Primed For Up To 50% Rally, Strategist Says  In this light, the wind power revolution canrsquot come fast enough. Just this month, the United Nations and the IPCC sounded a ldquocode red for humanityrdquo which stated in no uncertain terms that we have reached the point of no return for climate change, and the global clean energy transition must be swift and absolute in order to avoid the worst impacts of global warming. Wind energy will have to be a considerable part of that front.  The technology is already being scaled at unprecedented rates. 2020 saw more wind energy capacity installed in the United States than any other year before, and in 2019 wind power surpassed hydropower to be the countryrsquos top source of renewable energy in the same year that renewable energies overtook coal in the U.S. energy mix. This success story owes a lot to wind-friendly policy in the United States, where the federal government has been offering a tax credit to wind producers. That policy, however -- and subsidies in general -- has been controversial and the federal incentive was slated to end last year, resulting in a rush to expand production while the tax credit was still in place.nbsp  ldquoOn the one hand, these government motivators have been good enough that the U.S. now has the third-highest per capita wind power generation in the world,rdquo according to Marketplace. Thatrsquos a distant third, however, lagging far behind the global leaders, Denmark and Germany. Even after the massive expansion in 2020, the United Statesrsquo total wind energy capacity is just half that of Chinarsquos.nbsp ldquoOn the other hand, we are a distant third mdash behind Denmark and Germany. The U.S. total capacity is half of Chinarsquos, and our volatile and cyclical policy of subsidies followed by subsidy cancellations is part of the reason why. While wind power is unequivocally a reliable, cost-effective, and efficient means of carbon-free energy production, its continued expansion is no guarantee without broad support.nbsp  By Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.com",1,0.9968,"['energy', 'wind', ' ', 'power', 'potential', 'United', 'global', 'year', 'capacity', 'world', 'States']"
Renewable Energy Consumption Has Tripled In 10 Years,2021-08-29T16:00:00-05:00,"The is the sixth article in a series on BPrsquos recently-released Statistical Review of World Energy 2021. Previous articles were    Highlights From The BP Statistical Review Of World Energy 2021  A Record Decline In Carbon Emissions  The U.S. Remained The Worldrsquos Top Oil Producer In 2020  The U.S. Maintains Its Natural Gas Dominance  U.S. Coal Consumption Falls To 60-Year Low    Today, I want to cover renewable energy.  Renewable energy was the one category that bucked the global trend of declining energy consumption in 2020. Despite the 4.5% decline of primary global energy consumption mdash the largest since World War II mdash global renewable energy consumption grew by 9.7% in 2020. That was a slight decline from its 12.2% pace the year before, but itrsquos remarkable given how significantly the pandemic impacted total energy demand.  Over the past decade, renewable energy consumption has grown at an average annual rate of 13.4%. Renewables were the only category of energy that grew globally at double digits over the past decade.  For perspective, in 2010 the world consumed 9.6 exajoules of renewable energy. In 2020, that had tripled to 31.7 exajoules.    The ldquoRenewablesrdquo category above consists of wind power, solar power, biofuels, geothermal energy, and power produced from biomass. The report further breaks down renewable energy consumption into just power production i.e., without biofuels, and that accounts for 88% of all renewable energy consumption.  The Review reports ldquoHydroelectricityrdquo as a separate category. Thatrsquos because hydroelectricity represents a mature category of energy production that is growing globally at a much slower rate than modern renewables like solar power. Global hydropower consumption in 2020 was 38.2 exajoules, which is still more than the category that contains wind and solar. However, the 10-year average annual growth rate for hydropower is only 2.1%, versus 13.4% for the other renewables.    Globally, hydroelectricity represented 6.9% of the worldrsquos primary energy consumption in 2020, versus 5.7% for modern renewables.  Within the Renewable Power category, wind 50.6% and solar 27.2% accounted for most of the consumption. Although wind consumption maintains a healthy lead over solar consumption, solar power consumption continues to grow at nearly double the rate of wind power, and is likely to overtake it as the leading source of renewable power this decade.  China overtook the U.S. as the worldrsquos top consumer of renewable energy in 2018, and continues to extend its lead. Not only does China have the top spot for overall renewable consumption, its growth rate over the past decade vastly exceeds all other members of the Top 10. Cumulatively, the Top 10 consumers accounted for 75.9% of the worldrsquos renewable energy consumption in 2020.    Despite the blistering growth rate of renewables, itrsquos important to keep in mind that overall global energy consumption is growing. Even though global renewable energy consumption has increased by about 21 exajoules in the past decade, overall energy consumption has increased by 51 exajoules. Increased fossil fuel consumption made up most of this growth, with every category of fossil fuels showing increased consumption over the decade although coalrsquos growth was close to zero.  Thus, while renewables have helped reduce the growth of carbon dioxide emissions, global carbon emissions have grown due to the overall growth rate of fossil energy consumption. However, because of the decline in overall energy consumption in 2020, renewable consumption did grow faster than overall energy consumption. In turn, global carbon dioxide emissions decreased by a whopping 6.3% in 2020.

Get Ready For The SPAC Frenzy In Clean Energy,2021-08-19T12:00:00-05:00,"Investors are increasingly piling into clean energy start-ups to take them public and help them raise funds to develop their low-carbon solutions.  Many of those investors opt to do so via the hottest Wall Street trend of last yearmdashSPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, commonly known as blank-check companies.  SPACs are public companies, and in recent years, they have become a popular vehicle for taking a private company public after a merger or an acquisition.  Blank-check companies are an opportunity for start-ups in the clean energy sector to access funding to develop their concept technology. For investors, setting up a SPAC and picking an alternative energy firm to help it list on the market is part of addressing the growing pressure on Wall Street for more capital and investments into renewable energy sources in the energy transition.  nbspStart-ups See SPAC Advantages  Blank-check companies could be a new investment opportunity for the energy sector, as well as a much-needed and more streamlined listing process for a start-up than the traditional initial public offering IPO, analysts say. SPACs also give early-stage start-ups, such that havenrsquot commercialized their product yet, access to funding.  Moreover, the target company and the SPAC have more control over the valuation of the business, unlike in the typical IPO process where the market usually dictates how much the market valuation should be.  Sure, there were some notorious flops after SPACs took start-ups public. The most notorious of all is the case of Nikola Motors, whose founder Trevor Milton was indicted last month by a grand jury with three counts of criminal fraud for lying about ldquonearly all aspects of the business.rdquo  Milton maintains he is innocent and that ldquothis is a new low in the governmentrsquos efforts to criminalize lawful business conduct. Every executive in America should be horrified.rdquo  Lordstown Motors, which went public after a SPAC takeover last year, warned in June that it was running out of cash and could collapse by yearrsquos end. The SEC has started an investigation into Lordstown Motorsrsquo vehicle pre-orders and its merger with SPAC DiamondPeak Holdings.  The SEC has also reportedly opened a general inquiry into SPAC deals over potential conflicts of interest, with banks acting as underwriters and advisers at the same time.  nbspSPACs Targeting Clean Energy Are Booming  Despite these potential red flags about the SPAC boom on Wall Street, the blank-check company frenzy continues, including with green energy start-ups.  SPAC managers need to perform careful due diligence to pick the clean energy firms that could make it big and disrupt their sector, analysts say.  ldquoEnergy companies with a technology aspect to their business or a focus on renewable energy may be best placed to take advantage on the SPAC boom,rdquo Jack Mason-Jebb, corporate solicitor, and Brad Isaac, corporate partner, at European law firm Fieldfisher wrote in May.  Amid the SPAC boom, more and more blank-check companies include investment bankers and executives with previous experience in the oil and gas sector, according to SEC filings of SPACs reviewed by Reuters.  They have already set up 20 blank-check companies, and more are coming, as per Reuters data.  The SPAC frenzy has reached the renewable energy business, with a lot of high-profile deals announced in recent months. For example, Li-Cycle, the biggest battery resource recycling firm in North America, said in February that it would list on NYSE through a merger with Peridot Acquisition Corp, a publicly traded SPAC sponsored by Carnelian Energy Capital. Altus Power, a solar power developer, is merging with CBRE Acquisition Holdings, with the combined business expected to be listed on the NYSE. Heliogen, which provides AI-enabled concentrated solar power, is merging with the SPAC Athena Technology Acquisition Corp.  ldquoChairwoman Isabelle Freidheim and I co-founded Athena with a mission to work with disruptive technology companies with the potential to advance industry, and even society, through innovation. Heliogen absolutely meets that standard, not only in terms of solar-power generation, but in its ability to produce other sources of clean energy that may replace fossil fuels,rdquo Athenarsquos CEO Phyllis Newhouse said.  nbspMore SPAC Funding for Clean Energy Is Coming  ldquoClimate tech companies are taking advantage of the popularity of SPACs and leveraging the vehicle for liquidity and capital,rdquo Silicon Valley Bank SVB said in a report last month.  SVB expects between $35 billion and $40 billion to flow to U.S.-based, venture capital-backed climate tech companies through SPACs in the next 24 months.    ldquoAs the dangers of climate change have become clearer and the technologies aimed at reducing these impacts have matured, more investors and entrepreneurs have turned their attention to climate tech,rdquo said Kelly Belcher, Managing Director of SVBrsquos Energy amp Resource Innovation ERI practice and author of the report.  As of the spring of 2021, as many as 28 SPAC-acquired companies involved in the energy transition were trading on public markets, with a median market capitalization of $1.1 billion, data from Wood Mackenzie and accounting firm CohnReznick showed.  ldquoClean energy SPACs will likely experience another record-setting year in 2021,rdquo CohnReznickrsquos mini brief from May said.  At that time, WoodMac had already identified more than 50 launched or announced SPACs that would target the energy transition and decarbonization sectors, with over $15 billion in total funding at the time of IPO.  But itrsquos not so easy to find a target matching all the requirements of the SPAC and its sponsorsmdashnot every start-up with promising technology to change the world will make it.  ldquoWhat SPACs do is allow industry experts to raise money and go find a diamond in the rough,rdquo Travis Wofford, vice-chair of mergers and acquisitions at law firm Baker Botts, told Quartzrsquo climate reporter Tim McDonnell last month.nbsp  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com",1,0.9933,"[' ', 'SPAC', 'energy', 'companies', 'SPACs', 'start', 'public', 'ups', 'check', 'firm', 'business']"
Big Oil's Foray Into Renewables Has Completely Changed The Market,2021-08-19T17:00:00-05:00,"That the oil and gas industry is problematic is perhaps too mild a way to put it. Fossil fuel producers have recently become the singular target of accusations and lawsuits from parties arguing that they are the only industry responsible for the effects of a changing climate. And now those same fossil fuel producers are coming after renewables.  Big Oil is trying to green itself up, so it is bidding for wind farm construction tenders and buying other renewables assets. And in doing this, it is undermining the profit margins of renewable energy companies, Bloombergrsquos Will Mathis recently wrote in an article.  There is a certain irony in the situation. Thanks to a surprisingly strong rebound in oil demand, Big Oil can afford to be generous with its wind and solar purchases and bids. On the other hand, devastating supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic have prompted price increases in a lot of commodities, including raw materials for solar panels, making the panels costlier as well.  Neither of these trends is Big Oilrsquos fault, and yet it is the industry benefiting from them. According to Mathis, however, it is Big Oilrsquos fault that Oslashrsted, for instance, reported lower financial results for the first half of the year.    According to the Danish turbine maker itself, however, the lower results were related to a 4-percent decline in electricity output, which was the result of lower average wind speeds in the period.  ldquoEarnings from our offshore and onshore wind farms in operation were DKK 0.3 billion lower compared to the same period last year,rdquo Oslashrsted said in its first-half report, released earlier this month. ldquoThe increased generation capacity from new wind farms in operation was more than offset by significantly lower wind speeds across our portfolio.rdquo  Mathis also cited the other big Danish name in wind turbines, Vestas, as suffering from Big Oilrsquos foray into its turf. Vestas, however, blamed the effects of Covid-19 on its lower first-quarter results and then reported stronger results for the second quarter as demand for wind generation capacity continued strong.  Another company mentioned in the article that laments the entry of Big Oil into renewables is Siemens Gamesa. The company itself attributed its weaker performance earlier this year to ldquoThe sharp increase of raw material pricesrdquo as well as to ldquoIncreased estimates of ramp-up costs for the Siemens Gamesa 5.X platform, especially in Brazil.rdquo  Related JP Morgan Donrsquot Expect A lsquoShockrsquo Transition In Energy Markets  Now, there seems to be nothing easier than dumping the blame for everything that goes wrong in renewable energy onto Big Oil. When oilmdashand gasmdashis cheap, it is to blame for the lower uptake of EV and an overall feeling of discouragement in the adoption of wind and solar. When oil is expensive, it is expensive because of demand, and fills Big Oilrsquos coffers with cash that they can then use to encroach on renewablersquos territory.  One would imagine that this is a reason for celebrationmdashafter all, with all that cash, Big Oil could do a lot to help the fast expansion of wind and solar generation capacity that the world is believed to need in order to avoid the worst of the climate change fallout. Yet, as Bloombergrsquos Mathis notes, this intensifies competition in the space.  Competition should be the natural order of things, and rather than a reason for worry, it should be welcomed as a motivational push. This should be all the truer if the assertion Mathis makesmdashthat ldquoGreen energy is now the cheapest source of electricity in most of the worldrdquomdashreflects reality. Consumers are attracted to cheap things and willing to pay for a lot of them. This should be good for margins all around, even with Big Oil in the game.  Unfortunately, the ldquocheapest source of electricityrdquo adage does not reflect reality to the extent that the authors who use it would like. It is a fact that the costs of wind and solar farms have declined dramatically over the last decade or so as technology improved and raw material costs fell due to abundant supply.  However, it is worth noting that both technologies are strongly reliant on government subsidies. China didnrsquot cancel wind and solar subsidies because it felt like it a couple of years ago. It canceled them because it could no longer afford to support those projects.  Shell, BP, and TotalEnergies, on the other hand, can afford to pay millions upon millions to beat competitors for new renewable energy projects. They are highly motivated, with shareholders, governments, and environmentalists looking over their shoulders at how they are tackling their carbon footprints. And however blasphemous it may sound to the ideologically inclined, they are partnering with renewables companies.  The thing about business is that it is not driven by ideology. Business is driven by the need to turn in a profit. Orsed, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa know this, as do BP, Shell, and TotalEnergies. The influx of competitors in the wind and solar space is bound to sooner or later result in partnerships of mutual benefit. This would help Big Oil morph into Big Energy. Like it or not, it would be the natural way.  By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com",-1,0.9713,"[' ', 'wind', 'Big', 'Oil', 'solar', 'lower', 'Mathis', 'renewables', 'energy', 'Oilrsquos', 'results']"
Big Oil Will Rule The Energy Transition,2021-08-16T13:00:00-05:00,"Big Oil and renewables look like polar opposites to many who follow the energy transition from a distance. After all, this transition is a response prompted by the decades-long polluting activity of Big Oil. And yet, there is a big chance that Big Oil will own this transition, as well as the renewable future that follows.  On one level, the reason for this is purely technical. One might think that the oil industry and the wind power industry have nothing in common, but in fact, they do, as Giovanni Corbetta from James Fisher Renewables wrote in a recent article for World Oil.  The installation of wind turbines in the sea, especially in deep waters, is pretty similar to installing oil platforms, especially floating platforms. Hinting that floating wind turbine technology would be impossible without floating oil platform technology, Corbetta points out that some technologies now utilized in the renewable energy sector originated in oil and gas.  This connection is evident in Big Oil's quick foray into wind power when pressure began to be felt about their carbon footprints. The supermajors simply felt most comfortable with wind, particularly offshore wind. The latest evidence of this deep connection between the two was BP's announcement last month that it planned to invest close to $14 billion 10 billion pounds to turn Aberdeen, in Scotland, into its global offshore wind hub. And, according to the company, the wind hub is only the beginning.    Through our bid we aim to do far more than only develop offshore wind ndash we believe it can help fuel Scotland's wider energy transition, said BP's Dev Senyal, executive VP for gas and low carbon, as quoted by Scottish Construction Now. We want to harness the clean power from Scotland's offshore wind and use our capabilities as an integrated energy company to accelerate the country's EV charging network, build its hydrogen offering and strengthen its supporting infrastructure, including ports and harbours, Devyal also said.  Yet, technology is not the only connection between oil and gas, and renewables. There is also the business expertise that has made the oil industry a lucrative choice for investors for decades. This is now changing, thanks to the push for a green shift, and Big Oil is changing with it.  French TotalEnergies, for instance, recently closed a deal with Amazon to supply it with electricity produced from renewable sources. The French supermajor will provide the commodity through power purchase agreements in Europe and the United States. Plans are to later expand this agreement to the Middle East and the Asia Pacific.  One would think that the supply of renewable power should bemdashand would bemdashthe prerogative of those who generate it. But, apparently, this is not the case. Big Oil has the experience and expertise to spot any opportunity for growth and profit and grab it while it's there. This is not to say that renewable energy companies are ignorant about business opportunities and how to take advantage of them. Big Oil has simply had more time to learn how to do it well. It also has more motivation with shareholders, banks, and governments breathing down its neck about emissions.  One other avenue of expansion for Big Oil into renewables is simplemdashMampA. Shell recently closed the acquisition of Inspire Energy Capitalmdasha U.S. renewable energy retailer that supplies customers with renewable power under a variety of subscription plans and also offers incentives for better electricity use management.  Our goal is to become a major provider of renewable and low-carbon energy, and this acquisition moves us a step closer to achieving that, said Shell executive VP for Renewable amp Energy Solutions, Elizabeth Brinton.  This deal instantly expands our business-to-consumer power offerings in key regions in the U.S., and we are well-positioned to build on Inspire's advanced digital capabilities to allow more households to benefit from renewable and low-carbon energy, she added.  Big Oil is not shy about its plans to own the energy transition. It does not have to be, not now, when it has the money to buy all the assets it wants to grow in renewables. In fact, oil and gas buyers of renewable assets are so generous, Bloomberg recently accused them of interfering with the profits of these assets' previous owners. Ironically, while Big Oil enjoyed the windfall of rising oil prices, the two largest wind farm developers in the world reported lower profits. But not because of Big Oil squeezing their profits. It was because of lower electricity output due to lower wind speeds.  The idea that Big Oil could come to dominate the energy transition would hardly be palatable to many who singularly place responsibility for the need for an energy transition on the fossil fuel industry. Yet this is one likely scenario Big Oil has the means, the motive, and the opportunity to make the energy transition its own.

New Energy Companies Post Mixed Earnings Despite Pivot To Renewables,2021-08-11T15:00:00-05:00,"Oil and gas companies have been shooting the lights out this earnings season, with the energy sector recording the highest growth of any of the U.S.' 11 sectors. The sector has so far reported Q2 revenue growth of 112.8% Y/Y, more than three times the growth clip by the second-placed Materials sector. Big Oil has been particularly impressive, with ExxonMobil NYSEXOM, Chevron NYSECVX, Shell NYSERDS.A and TotalEnergies NYSETTE all swinging to large profits after a dismal showing a year ago.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about Big Oil's green energy peers.  Top solar names First Solar NASDAQFSLR and Enphase Energy Inc. NASDAQENPH have easily topped Wall Street's expectations however,nbsp the latest spate of green earnings has been a mixed bag.  This comes after President Biden came out with an executive order on Thursday aimed at making half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 electric battery-electric, fuel cell, and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The move is the latest in Biden's plan to fight climate change, in this case by targeting emissions from cars and trucks.  Surprisingly, the three leading Detroit automakers General Motors NYSEGM, Ford NYSEF,nbsp and Chrysler parent Stellantis N.V. NYSESTLA have issued a joint statement supporting Biden's ambitious plan. The three have announced their shared aspiration to achieve sales of 40-50% of annual U.S. volumes of electric vehicles by 2030.  Here is the latest set of earnings in the green energy sector.  1. Fisker  Last week, electric vehicles and mobility solutions company Fisker, Inc.NYSEFSR delivered Q2 2021 results.nbsp  Fisker reported Q2 GAAP EPS of -$0.16 with cash and cash equivalents of $962 million as of June 30, 2021, as well as zero debt. Net cash used in operating activities totaled $28.1 million during the quarter, and cash paid for capital expenditures totaled $0.3 million.  Fisker remains a speculative play since it won't start production of EV SUVs until 2023 and probably won't start making serious cash until late 2021 on advance orders.  Fisker announced that the development of the Fisker Ocean SUV remains on track for expected November 17, 2022 start-of-production and full ramp up production volume reaching over 5,000 assembled units per month during 2023.nbsp The battery-electric SUV will start at $37,499, promising a range of 300 miles, in addition to features like a solar roof.  While Fisker touted its unique asset-light strategy that allows the company to work on multiple platforms and vehicles concurrently, the market appears unimpressed, with FSR stock down 10% over the last five trading sessions.  Perhaps investors feel that Fisker has not been moving fast enough and will come into a market rife with competition, especially now that the ICE giants have doubled down. Though non-binding, the 50% target is likely to attract billions of dollars in EV investments from both the private and public sectors over the next decade. Biden has already called for $174 billion in government spending to boost EVs, including $100 billion in consumer incentives. A bipartisan Senate infrastructure bill includes $7.5 billion for EV charging stations though it has remained mute as far as new consumer incentives go.  Consulting firm AlixPartners says investments in EVs could total $330 billion by 2025, with EVs likely to reach 24% of total sales by 2030.  2. PlugPower  Hydrogen fuel cell maker Plug Power NASDAQPLUG has reported mixed results but still managed to impress after reporting huge billing growth. PlugPower has reported Q2 GAAP EPS of -$0.18, missing the Wall Street consensus by $0.11, but revenue of $124.56M 83.0% Y/Y beats by $13.35M.  PlugPower says it shipped 3,666 GenDrive units vs. 2,683 GenDrive units in the year-ago quarter.  Gross billings were $126.3M last quarter compared to $72.4M a year ago.  Related Why Norway Wonrsquot Give Up On Oil amp Gas  President and CEO Andrew Marsh says that growth in the electrolyzer business is up over 400% Y/Y in 2021 and is expected to continue recording robust growth through 2024. The strong growth encouraged the company to raise its full-year gross bookings guidance to $500M. For FY 2022, Plug has set a target for $750M in gross bookings.  PLUG stock has surged 11% in early trading on Monday.  Last month, Citigroup initiated coverage on PLUG with a Buy rating and a $35 price target saying the nascent hydrogen economy is at the cusp of a breakout and Plug leads the way.  Hydrogen stocks have badly lagged in 2021 after enjoying a breakout season in 2020 mainly on valuation concerns. The Defiance Next Gen H2 ETF NYSEARCAHYDRO is down nearly 30% since its April launch.  3. Ballard Power Systems Inc.  Ballard Power Systems NASDAQBLDP is another hydrogen name that has reported mixed second-quarter results.  Ballard Power reported Q2 GAAP EPS of -$0.07, missing the Wall Street estimate by $0.02 while revenue of $25M -3.1% Y/Y beats by $3.82M. Adjusted EBITDA clocked in at -$19.7 million, compared to -$8.0 million a year ago, primarily due to margin compression and rising cash operating costs. The company reported that Q2 2021 gross margin fell 600 basis points to 15%, driven primarily by the decrease in total revenues, combined with a shift to lower overall product margin and service revenue mix.  BLDP has been deeply out of favor this year after a series of earnings misses. However, the company is still regarded as one of the top hydrogen fuel cell brands, and its lofty target of 46% annual sales growth through 2030 makes it worth watching.

How Can Emerging Markets Capitalize On Geothermal Energy's Potential,2021-08-11T13:00:00-05:00,"While solar and wind are the dominant segments in the transition to renewables, a number of emerging markets are looking to geothermal sources as a way to meet future energy needs.  Geothermal energy ndash which is generated when pipes drilled into the earthrsquos surface supply steam to power electricity turbines ndash lags behind other forms of renewables in terms of installed capacity however, it is an effective solution for many countries.  Geothermal on the rise in Kenya  One of the countries leveraging its significant geothermal potential is Kenya. Located on the Great Rift Valley ndash where tectonic plates meet and bring magma closer to the earthrsquos surface ndash Kenya derives almost half of its electricity from geothermal sources, according to Fitch Solutions, with its contribution set to expand to nearly three-fifths by 2030.  As part of plans to boost geothermal capacity, in July the state-owned Kenya Electricity Generating Company, also known as KenGen, announced its intention to invest $2bn over the next five years on new plants and modernisation. These efforts are expected to double installed geothermal capacity to around 1600 MW.  The company aims to bring the 83.8-MW Olkaria I Unit 6 plant, which is currently under construction, on-line later this year, while the Geothermal Development Company, another state-owned body, has plans to complete the construction of three geothermal plants in Menengai with a combined capacity of 105 MW in 2023.  The benefits of Kenyarsquos geothermal expansion extend beyond generating electricity the country has begun to export its expertise to some of its East African neighbours.  Related Analysts See Oil Trading Closer To $70 Through Year-End  In February KenGen won a $6.6m contract to drill geothermal wells in Djibouti, and in late May the company began drilling works as part of a $69.7m deal in Ethiopia. KenGen has also said it is in talks to undertake projects in both Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as the region increasingly looks to tap its geothermal resources.  South-east Asiarsquos main players  While the US is the worldrsquos leading producer of geothermal energy, a number of other emerging markets play key roles on the international scene, with Indonesia and the Philippines alone accounting for around 25% of the worldrsquos geothermal energy production.  With installed capacity of around 2100 MW, Indonesia is the worldrsquos second-largest producer, and is on track to overtake the US by the end of the decade the countryrsquos geothermal development roadmap foresees a rapid of expansion of geothermal capacity to 8000 MW by 2030.  To achieve this, the government implemented a series of incentives to encourage development. These include a November 2020 law that streamlined the approval process for geothermal projects and removed a production fee for using geothermal resources a number of fiscal incentives ndash such as tax allowances or exemptions ndash have also been introduced.  Related Shell Reports $5.5 Billion Net Profit And Hikes Dividends  Meanwhile, in the Philippines around three-quarters of energy is produced from fossil fuels, compared to 12% from geothermal sources. However, the segment is expected to remain the largest renewable energy source through to 2030, and the country has plans to double capacity by 2040, up from just under 2000 MW at present.  Challenges and opportunities  Despite encouraging recent developments, geothermal energy has yet to realise its full global potential.  Worldwide geothermal electricity generation stood at 92 TWh in 2019, according to the International Energy Agency IEA, far below comparable statistics for hydropower 4333 TWh, onshore and offshore wind 1390 TWh, and solar 720 TWh.  Furthermore, the IEA says that worldwide geothermal capacity is not on track to meet the UNrsquos Sustainable Development Goal targets of 162 TWh and 282 TWh by 2025 and 2030, respectively.  While natural and technological factors have undoubtedly contributed to this, there have been some other key issues hindering the widespread rollout of geothermal projects.  Chief among these is the cost of the initial investment. For example, in Kenya it is estimated that a single well can cost up to $6m to drill. While geothermal energy is generally considered to be a more reliable form of baseload power than solar, wind or hydropower ndash sources that rely on more variable elements such as sunshine, wind or water flow ndash the cost of bringing geothermal projects on-line can be prohibitive.  In late 2018 it was announced that Malaysiarsquos first geothermal project, a 37-MW plant in the state of Sabah, had been abandoned amid concerns over the cost of drilling.  In many cases, as in Malaysia, other forms of renewable energy have been favoured as part of their renewable energy transitions.  In Mexico ndash which, with 950 MW of installed power, is one of the top-10 geothermal energy-producing countries in the world ndash investment has stalled in recent years, with successive administrations prioritising other energy sources.  Although improvements in technology are bringing down the cost of drilling, and there has been an increase in support for developers in countries like Indonesia, some in the industry have called for additional incentives to encourage development.  ldquoGeothermal holds enormous potential for countries like Indonesia and the Philippines, where there is the possibility for advanced technology to produce endless power from a heat source deep inside of the earth,rdquo K K Ralhan, group chairman of Singapore-headquartered company Kaltimex Group, told OBG.  ldquoTo realise this potential, governments need to step up reforms and provide sufficient incentives, whether this be in terms of feed-in tariffs or tax breaks, to ensure that this is economically viable for entrepreneurs.rdquo  By Oxford Business Group",1,0.9979,"[' ', 'geothermal', 'energy', 'ndash', 'capacity', 'MW', '$', 'TWh', 'sources', 'countries', 'Kenya']"
High Service Costs The Reality Of Owning An EV,2021-08-07T14:00:00-05:00,"Days ago we pointed out a report that dove into the unique risks of placing lithium ion batteries all over the world including in electric vehicles. And just over the last two months, we've written not only about how much driving needs to be done in EVs to make them better for the environment than internal combustion engine vehicles, but we've also noted that EV carbon footprints aren't necessarily as better than ICE vehicles as many people think.Now, the hits keep on coming we're finding out that EVs cost more to service than internal combustion engine vehicles. Like the reduction in environmental harm that we noted last month, however, the gap narrows over time.Automotive News published a report on Thursday of this week noting that EVs were 2.3 times more expensive to service than ICE vehicles after three months of ownership. Analytics firm We Predict compiled the data by looking at roughly 19 million vehicles between the 2016 and 2021 model years.That figure drops to just 1.6 times more expensive after one year, the report noted, as a result of a 77% drop in maintenance costs and a decline in repair costs. The data showed that service techs spend about twice as much time diagnosing problems with EVs as they do with regular gas vehicles. They spend about 1.5 times longer fixing them and the labor rate for repairs was about 1.3 times higher. It's an industry in launch. This is the launch factor you're seeing, said Renee Stephens, a vice president at We Predict.EVs had a high rate of wheel problems, the study found. This was attributed to wear and tear associated with carrying bulky batteries. Ford's Mach-E scored the best marks in terms of cost of service. After 3 months of ownership, the Mach-E service costs were $93, compared to $366 for the Audi E-Tron and $667 for the Porsche Taycan.

Renewables Need Big Oil To Thrive,2021-08-05T15:00:00-05:00,"We need the expertise, experience, and financial backing of Big Oil to drive wind energy forward in the U.S., following years of strong investments from oil firms across the country kickstarting the industry.nbsp  As activists and international agencies continue to criticize Big Oil for its role in climate change and environmental degradation, it is precisely those firms that have made some of the more significant investments and added some of the greatest value to renewable energy projects across North America.nbsp  Wind capacity is expected to increase by 60 percent over the next five years from 100,000 megawatts MW at present. And the global offshore wind market could reach a value of $87.5 billion by 2026 according to predictions, an increase from just $36.1 billion in 2019. However, it will require significant investment and know-how from seasoned energy experts to get wind projects off the ground and meet this demand.nbsp  In April this year, Chevron became the first U.S. oil major to invest in offshore wind, signing a deal with Norwayrsquos Moreld to develop Ocergy, a turbine technology company. It follows in the footsteps of European majors Shell, Equinor, and Total, which all have well-established offshore wind energy projects.    The offshore development is part of Chevronrsquos $300 million low-carbon investment plan. The development will see the construction of floating offshore wind turbines which will be used to power part of the U.S. grid.nbsp  Similar projects have already been seen in other areas of the world as Shell, with partners SSE Renewables and Equinor, is currently developing the worldrsquos largest wind farm in the northeast of England. Phases A and B of the Dogger Bank Wind Farm will have a combined power generation capacity of 2,400 MW.nbsp  Related Top U.S. Negotiator Iran Nuclear Deal May Be Impossible  Now oil tycoon Phil Anschutz is investing in Americarsquos biggest wind energy project, after a decade of setting the groundwork and applying for permits. The $5 billion project in Wyoming will see a personal investment of $400 million from Anschutz who is seeking equity partners to finance the remaining share. The development, expected to be completed by 2025, will see 1000 wind turbines up and running across 320,000-acres upon completion, enough to power 1.8 million homes across California.nbsp  One of the main attractions of wind is its similarity to oil and gas. An IEA report found that around 40 percent of the costs of offshore wind, such as the construction and maintenance of huge structures, overlap with the costs of the offshore oil industry.  In addition, with mounting pressure from governments and international agencies to go green, oil majors are looking at ways to invest in a future beyond oil and gas. While carbon capture technology has been a major move for most firms, some are looking to develop their renewable energy sectors to ensure their stake in international energy in the years to come.nbsp  Some companies have already made the switch from oil to wind rather than simply adding to their portfolios such as Denmark-based Oslashrsted. This is not surprising given the financial potential for wind energy development and the underexploited nature of the industry in the U.S.nbsp  At present, wind energy accounts for just 0.3 percent of global electricity today. But with significant projects planned for the U.S. over the next decade, Big Oil could have a hand in boosting this figure exponentially.nbsp  By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.comnbsp",1,0.9766,"['wind', ' ', 'energy', 'oil', 'offshore', 'U.S.', 'projects', '$', 'development', 'Big', 'Oil']"
Do Lithium Batteries Pose A Major Fire Hazard,2021-08-04T14:00:00-05:00,"Last Friday, a Megapack at the worldrsquos biggest energy storage construction site caught fire. It took firefighters three days to put the fire out. In a way, however, the incident, which took place in Australia, ignited another fire a debate about the safety of lithium-ion batteries.  Media coverage of energy storage rarely mentions any risks. The focus is invariably on bigger and better storage in anticipation of the future low-carbon energy systems that we are now trying to build. New technologiesmdashincluding alternatives to lithium-ion batteriesmdashare a frequent topic, and stats and forecasts about storage capacity are also a favorite.nbsp  Combustion risks, not so much.  Yet, like EV batteries, energy storage batteries like the Tesla Megapacks at the Victoria, Australia, site are prone to combustion under the right circumstancesmdashbecause of the things they are made of.  An article in the Australian website EcoGeneration lists some of the flammable elements of a lithium-ion battery the liquid electrolyte through which those famed lithium ions travel is flammable, for example. So is the graphite in the anode and the plastic in the insulation of the battery.nbsp  But how do fires start in batteries In short, they start when optimum operating conditions are compromised, according to an associate professor from the Australian National University and Research Lead in Battery Materials in ANUrsquos Battery Storage and Grid Integration Program, who spoke to EcoGeneration.  Related Shell Reports $5.5 Billion Net Profit And Hikes Dividends  Batteries are sensitive to overheating and overcharging, Alexey Glushenkov explained to EcoGeneration. Overheating initially happens in a single battery cell but can quickly spread to all the other cells in a battery pack. Battery manufacturers seek to minimize the chance of that happening. Unfortunately, recent battery incidents have proven that it is not always possible to completely eliminate the danger.  When a battery cell overheats, gases begin to build up inside it, swelling it and eventually opening it, allowing oxygen to come in and spark a fire.nbsp  But how does overheating happen By overcharging, which can also cause unwanted chemical reactions in the battery cellsmdashagain threatening fire.  The most common cause for all of this is a short circuit. According to Glushenkov, it could be the result of a bad battery design or a manufacturing defect. Short circuits can also start at a molecular level when overcharging the battery cell results in the buildup of metallic lithium in the anode. These buildups grow into what are commonly known as dendrites.    ldquoAs the process happens again and again those structures, called dendrites, can penetrate the separator [between the two electrodes],rdquo he says. ldquoA short circuit will result and the battery discharges instantaneously, causing a lot of heat to be generated.rdquo  The risk of a fire is certainly a problem, but perhaps a bigger one is that extinguishing that fire is not as easy as putting out a ldquonormalrdquo fire. This is because of all the chemicals that go into making a battery cell. Those chemicals create the gases that build up in batteries right before they explode.  ldquoWe donrsquot have a definitive answer of what is the best way to deal with an EV [electric vehicle] fire or energy storage fire,rdquo Newcastle University professor Paul Christensen told the Financial Times, commenting on the Victorian Big Battery incident.  ldquoThey [lithium-ion batteries] are essential to the decarbonisation of this planet but their penetration into society has far outstripped our actual knowledge of the risks and hazards associated with them,rdquo he added.  One might suggest that the risk is minimal otherwise, we would be hearing about battery storage fires every day. But, in fact, there have been quite a few battery storage fires recently, according to Christensen a total of 38, in fact, since 2018, including one at an Orsted battery storage site in the UK, and one in Arizona, at a battery storage facility operated by Arizona Public Services.  There are ldquomany similar battery enclosures operating today that could experience the exact same kind of failure,rdquo warned Matthew Paiss, a technical advisor on battery materials and systems at the pacific Northwestern National Laboratory, at the Energy Storage Summit USA earlier this year.  The way to reduce the risk is to ensure the rapid release of gasses built up in a battery cell, according to experts. Yet achieving this rapid release may be easier said than done. In the meantime, the risk will only grow, as the FT notes, because of the wider adoption of lithium-ion batteries, including in households.  ldquo2020 was a record year for global energy storage,rdquo said Wood Mackenziersquos head of energy storage, Dan Finn-Foley, earlier this year. ldquoThe market exceeded 15 GW/27 GWh in 2020, increasing 51% in GWh terms, and is expected to grow 27 times by 2030 by adding 70 GWh of storage capacity a year to surpass 729 GWh in 2030.rdquo  This rate of growth will likely make the need to reduce the risk of fires more urgent. Whether it will be addressed with an appropriate urgency remains to be seen.

The Sun Is Shining On Solar Stocks This Summer,2021-08-02T17:00:00-05:00,"After struggling for weeks trying to work out details of how to pay for the legislation, a bipartisan group of lawmakers is reportedly close to finishing their behind-the-scenes negotiations and unveil a $1.2T infrastructure bill. The bill includes $550B in new spending, with analysts generally bullish about its chances of passing in the Senate, though its fate in the House remains uncertain.  The newest issue of Barron's has analyzed several infrastructure plays that could benefit from the new federal spending with the likes of Caterpillar NYSECAT, Deere NYSEDE, United Rentals NYSEURI, Vulcan Materials NYSEVMC, Martin Marietta Materials NYSEMLM, and Terex NYSETEX jumping after the latest development.  Unfortunately, the solar sector remains rather muted, with the Invesco Solar Portfolio ETF NYSEARCATAN up a mere 0.74% on Monday's pre-market session. After a monstrous 2020, TAN has been a notable laggard in the current year, having lost 16.7% in the year-to-date as the sector continues to struggle with rising costs and supply chain constraints.  On a brighter note, several leading solar names have just returned their second-quarter scorecards--and so far, so good.  Another big development the Biden administration will soon launch a tool that allows instant permitting of rooftop solar installations, a major pain point for solar companies.The Department of Energy says the Solar Automated Permit Processing platform will become a standard portal for local governments to automatically process permit applications, rather than the current typical time over a week or more.  Here's how solar companies have performed during the ongoing earnings season.  1. First Solar  First Solar NASDAQFSLR, the largest solar manufacturer in America and the third-largest in the world, has just posted impressive second-quarter results.  First Solar has reported Q2 GAAP EPS of $0.77, topping Wall Street's consensus by $0.23 while revenue of $629M -2.1% Y/Y beat by $8.55M. For the full year 2021, the company says it expects EPS of $4.0-$4.6 vs. a consensus of $4.04, on revenues of $2.875B-$3.1B vs. $2.93B consensus.  Related Shell Reports $5.5 Billion Net Profit And Hikes Dividends  First Solar manufactures solar panels, photovoltaic power plants, and related services, including construction, maintenance, and recycling of solar products. The Tempe, Arizona-based company employs thin-film semiconductor technology to achieve enhanced efficiency and sustainability in its solar modules.nbsp  First Solar is one of the companies expected to benefit after the Biden administration was banned imports of polysilicon from Xinjiang, China, a region responsible for supplying 45% of the world's solar-grade polysilicon, thanks to the company recently committing to building more solar panels in the United States.  Cowen analyst Jeff Osborne says the latest development is a positive for First Solar given the company does not use polysilicon and could lead to accelerating orders from utility-scale developers looking to avoid traceability issues in the future.  But that's just part of what makes this solar stock attractive right now.  Last month, First Solar committed to building a new 3GW per year panel factory in Ohio at a cost of $680M. The company says it seeks to reshore manufacturing that has moved outside the United States, bolstered by President Biden's ambitious clean energy goals. CEO Mark Widmar says the company's three Ohio plants combined would produce panels that could generate 6 GW of power annually by 2025, more than half of all solar panels the company estimates will be produced annually in the U.S.  But here's another big reason why American solar stocks like First Solar are soaring Solar tax credits.  While the Biden administration has not named solar yet as a manufacturing priority, it supports extending tax credits for solar panel purchases or requiring federal contractors to purchase more solar panels from U.S. suppliers.  U.S. solar manufacturers are fully in support of the proposed tax credits saying they could boost domestic production of solar panels while also creating tens of thousands of new jobs.  First Solar hasnbspbacked the tariffs saying they are essential to fight low-priced goods from abroad. However,nbsp industry specialists say tax credits are not enough, and hefty subsidies via tax breaks would be needed in addition to the tariffs, to get the sector really going.  2. Enphase  Enphase Energy Inc. NASDAQENPH is a Fremont, California-based company that designs and manufactures software-driven home energy solutions used in solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control.  ENPH has reported Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $0.53 beat by $0.11 GAAP EPS of $0.28 beat by $0.02 while revenue of $316.05M 151.8% Y/Y beat by $4.82M.  The company reported that it shipped 796 MW DC, or 2,362,401 microinverters, during the quarter.  Enphase forecasts Q3 revenues of $335M-$355M, compared with a Wall Street consensus of $341.8M with non-GAAP gross margin of 38.0%-41.0%.  Despite the stronger than expected earnings, analysts have warned that ongoing semiconductor supply chain constraints are likely to hurt the company's outlook.  Related Natural Gas Deficit Causes Prices To Soar  Barclays analyst Moses Sutton says Enphase's update was uneven and could lead to another murky quarter,nbsp adding that he would buy the stock on weakness.  Evercore ISI's James West says he rates the stock at Outperform and raised his price target to $199 from $184 though he says the company's chip shortage likely will linger, although Q4 visibility has improved.     Riley's Christopher Souther says capacity constraints and COVID-19 will slow Enphase's aggressive sales into new markets and more execution in international markets is needed to ensure a competitive position in new markets.    3. Daqo New Energy  Daqo New Energy Corp. NASDAQDQ, a leading Chinese polysilicon maker with a factory in Xinjiang, is one of the companies that have been hurt by the import ban.  Luckily, the company has something else going for it.  DQ shares jumped 17% two weeks ago after its subsidiary, Xinjiang Daqo New Energy, completed its IPO process and began trading on the Shanghai Stock Exchange's Star Board.  Daqo says Xinjiang Daqo's shares closed at RMB61.11/share on the first day of trading, good for a massive 184% jump compared to the IPO price.  Although parent company Daqo was able to re-rate from the move, the gains appear to have been short-lived and DQ shares have cratered 25.3% from the post-IPO surge.  Nevertheless, the event is worth noting because Xinjiang Daqo is the first-ever listing in which a major subsidiary of a U.S.-listed entity has returned to the Star Board, with other solar names such as JinkoSolar NYSEJKS and Canadian Solar NASDAQCSIQ expected to follow suit.

Can The Middle East Really Become A Leader In Renewable Energy,2021-07-29T17:00:00-05:00,"To say that the six countries that make up the Gulf Cooperative Council GCC live and breathe hydrocarbons is hardly an exaggeration. About 60 years ago, the average city in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman was home to maybe a few thousand people fast forward to the present and many cities have transformed into world-class metropolises thanks to the region's vast oil and gas riches. Saudi Arabia alone owns 16% of the world's proven oil reserves and is also the world's second-largest oil producer, responsible for 15% of global output.  Unfortunately, the GCC's heavy reliance on oil and gas exports has proven to be a major Achilles heel during the energy crisis.  Last year, GCC nations led by Saudi Arabia put on a brave face and continued touting the strength of their economies, claiming they could withstand any scale of shocks. However, available evidence suggests pretty much the opposite that Gulf economies have been in dire straits thanks to low commodity prices and overreliance on oil and gas.  With oil prices averaging below $40/bbl in 2020, nearly all GCC nations faced massive budget deficits.  Despite being the lowest cost producer, the IMF estimates that Saudi Arabia requires oil prices at $76.10 to achieve fiscal breakeven, leaving the country with a huge budget deficit of 11.4% of GDP.nbsp  Other GCC countries have not been much better off.  The UAE has a fiscal breakeven oil price of $69.10/barrel Kuwait's is $61.10, while Bahrain and Oman need oil prices of $95.60 and $86.80, respectively, to balance their books.  Only Qatar, with a fiscal breakeven oil price of $39.90, was barely able to balance its books.  In the current year, oil prices appear set to remain range-bound in the $70-75/bbl range with global energy use in the current year expected to be only 0.5% above pre-Covid-19 levels as per the IEA's Global Energy Review 2021 report.    It's this kind of backdrop that has been forcing Gulf nations to restrategize and diversify their economies away from oil--and Saudi Arabia is leading the way, again.  Saudi Arabia Solar, Wind, and Hydrogen  Although Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman recently made waves in the oil community after telling Bloomberg News that Saudi Arabia intends to pump every last drop of oil and is going to be the last man standing, Saudi Arabia owns of the most ambitious clean energy blueprints Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 economic plan.  In the economic plan, Saudi Arabia has set a target to develop 60GW of renewable energy capacity by the end of the decade, which compares with an installed capacity of roughly 80GW of power plants burning gas or oil.nbsp  So far, Saudi Arabia has only made limited progress deploying renewables with just 300MW of utility-scale solar in operation while 400MW of wind power is under construction.nbsp  With its sun-scorched expanses and steady Red Sea breezes, Saudi Arabia is prime real estate for renewable energy generation. Last year, Saudi Arabia's national oil company Saudi Aramco sent shockwaves through the natural gas markets after it announced that it was kicking off the biggest shale gas development outside of the United States. Saudi Aramco said it plans to spend $110 billion over the next couple of years to develop the Jafurah gas field, which is estimated to hold 200 trillion cubic feet of gas. The state-owned company hopes to start natural gas production from Jafurah in 2024 and reach 2.2 Bcf/d of sales gas by 2036 with an associated 425 million cubic feet per day of ethane.nbsp  This year, Aramco announced that instead of chilling all that gas and exporting it as LNG, it will convert it into a much cleaner fuel Blue hydrogen.nbsp  Related Goldman Sachs Predicts Drastic Rise In Power Demand Due To EVs  Saudi Aramco has told investors that Aramco has abandoned immediate plans to develop its LNG sector in favor of hydrogen. Nasser said that the kingdom's immediate plan is to produce enough natural gas for domestic use to stop burning oil in its power plants and convert the remainder into hydrogen. Blue hydrogen is made from natural gas either by Steam Methane Reforming SMR or Auto Thermal Reforming ATR with the CO2 generated captured and then stored. As the greenhouse gasses are captured, this mitigates the environmental impacts on the planet.  Last year, Aramco made the world's first blue ammonia shipment--from Saudi Arabia to Japan. Japan--a country whose mountainous terrain and extreme seismic activity render it unsuitable for the development of sustainable renewable energy--is looking for dependable suppliers of hydrogen fuel, with Saudi Arabia and Australia on its shortlist.  The Saudi government is also building a $5 billion green hydrogen plant that will power the planned megacity of Neom when it opens in 2025. Dubbed Helios Green Fuels, the hydrogen plant will use solar and wind energy to generate 4GW of clean energy that will be used to produce green hydrogen.  But here's the main kicker Helios could soon produce green hydrogen that's cheaper than oil.  Bloomberg New Energy Finance BNEF estimates that Helios' costs could reach $1.50 per kilogram by 2030, way cheaper than the average cost of green hydrogen at $5 per kilogram and even cheaper than gray hydrogen made from cracking natural gas. Saudi Arabia enjoys a serious competitive advantage in the green hydrogen business thanks to its perpetual sunshine, wind, and vast tracts of unused land.  Germany has said it needs enormous volumes of green hydrogen and hopes Saudi Arabia will become a key supplier. Two years ago, Germany's cabinet committed to investing euro9B about $10.2B in hydrogen technology in anbsp bid to decarbonize the economy and cut CO2 emissions. The government has proposed to build an electrolysis capacity of 5,000MW by 2030 and anothernbsp 5,000MW by 2040 over the following decade to produce fuel hydrogen.  The European economic powerhouse has realized it cannot do this alone and will require low-cost suppliers like Saudi Arabia, especially as it doubles down on its green energy commitments following a series of devastating floods in the country.  UAE Nuclear, Wind, and Waste-to-Energynbsp  Back in April, the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation ENEC announced the commissioning of the country's first-ever nuclear power plant--the Barakah unit 1.  The 1,400-megawatt nuclear plant has become the single largest electricity generator in the UAE since reaching 100% power in early December and is now providing constant, reliable and sustainable electricity around the clock.ENEC says Barakah unit 1 is now leading the largest decarbonization effort of any industry in the UAE to date.  Following in the footsteps of Saudi Arabia, the UAE is also laying a strong foundation for the energy transition.  Masdar, the clean energy arm of Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, is building renewable capacity in central Asia after signing a deal in April 2021 to develop a solar project in Azerbaijan.  Since its inception in 2006, Masdar has built a portfolio of renewable energy assets in 30 different countries, having invested about $20bn to develop 11GW of solar, wind, and waste-to-energy power generation capacity.  And now Masdar says it intends to apply the lessons gleaned abroad to develop clean energy capacity back at home.  Solutions we have developed in our international operations will definitely have applications here in the UAE, says Masdar's El-Ramahi.  For instance, Masdar plans to bolster the UAE's comparatively weak wind resources by developing domestic wind farms using the latest class three turbines that are able to harness electricity even from low wind speeds.nbsp  Further, the company is also constructing a $1.1bn facility that will burn garbage to generate power in one of the world's largest waste-to-energy plants. Once complete, the plants will incinerate almost two-thirds of the household waste that the country generates every year.  Though not typically considered a clean energy source, modern waste-to-energy plants are much cleaner as per the United Nations Environmental Program UNEP. By using advanced technologies, these plants are able burn waste at extremely high temperatures, thus ensuring complete combustion while missions are specially treated, leaving minimal amounts of toxic byproducts like flue ash. In fact, tests have shown that the air emitted by certain waste-to-energy chimneys can be cleaner than the air flowing in.

Can The Biden Administration Meet Its Ambitious Offshore Wind Power Target,2021-07-29T15:00:00-05:00,"Earlier this year, the Biden administration said it planned to build offshore wind power generation capacity to the tune of 30 GW by 2030, creating more than 44,000 direct jobs and close to 33,000 indirect ones. To date, the United States has wind power capacity of 118 GW. Of this, only 42 MW is offshore wind. And According to IHS Markit, the 30 GW additional capacity target will almost certainly be missed.  Last year, the United States set a record in wind power capacity additions, at 14.2 GW added during the pandemic year. That was a continuation of another strong year in 2019, which also set a record in wind power additions, according to data from the Energy Information Bureau.  However, the reason for this boom in wind power generation capacity was not a simple response to greater demand for wind power. In fact, the reason for the records set in both 2019 and 2020 was the looming phase-out of the production tax credit, which spurred the mass deployment of wind and solar installations.  In December, Congress extended the production tax credit, which provided wind farm operators with a credit of $0.025 per kWh, until the end of this year. There are other incentives available to the wind industry, too. The biggest is the investment tax credit, which covers between 12 and 30 percent of investment costs at the start of the project. As of December, Congress has established a 30-percent investment tax credit for projects that start construction by December 2025.  So, with so much government help for the wind power industry, the 30 GW target in offshore wind should be a no-brainer. Yet, there are other factors at play besides government incentives and it is these factors, according to IHS Markit, that would make hitting the 30 GW target impossible.  For starters, the permitting process for offshore wind projects is lengthy and complicated, IHS Markitrsquos Andre Utkin wrote in a recent analysis of the topic. Then, there are not enough manufacturing facilities for the turbines, blades, and other equipment that goes into a utility-scale wind farm. The installation process is also tricky per U.S. legislation, only U.S.-flagged vessels can sail along the countryrsquos coasts. And there are not enough U.S.-flagged wind turbine installation and service vessels, according to IHSrsquos Utkin.  Related The 3 Nations Vying For Global LNG Dominance  Then there is the issue of transmission infrastructure. This is insufficient to accommodate an additional 30 GW of wind power capacity, according to the research firm. The transmission infrastructure problem is a global one, by the way. Earlier this year, IHSrsquos Utkin reported that global offshore wind power capacity was set to expand sixfold by 2030 thanks to technological advances, cost reductions, and government incentives. However, he added, ldquothe industry needs to rapidly develop and invest in new infrastructure to achieve these ambitious plans.rdquo  Finally, there is a regulatory hurdle, albeit not an insurmountable one. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management tends to conduct lengthy investigations of the impacts of wind farm construction on the environment, which will also likely delay projects.  In all fairness, many of these challenges can be dealt with by legislators, a majoritymdashalthough slimmdashof whom are clearly in favor of building the countryrsquos offshore wind power capacity. Some, however, are trickier because they do not depend on favorable policies. One example is the cost of building the necessary transmission infrastructure.  The recent $550-billion bipartisan infrastructure deal struck between the Senate and the White House envisages $73 billion in funding for clean energy generation and transmission. Yet copper prices are rising, and the offshore wind takes massive amounts of copper for its infrastructure. The $73 billion might simply be not enough for that and modernizing the U.S. aging grid.

Renewables Will Play A Vital Role In Energy Security For The U.S.,2021-07-28T14:00:00-05:00,"The United Statesrsquo energy independence is under threat. For years, the gush of cheap and abundant shale oil and gas out of the West Texas Permian Basin has allowed the U.S. some degree of energy security and sovereignty, as well as giving the nation a great deal of sway in global energy markets. But U.S. energy titans and politicians have gotten complacent. As the country has doggedly stuck to the status quo, the rest of the world has been investing heavily in clean energy infrastructure, research, and development. And the United States is getting left behind in the dust.nbspThis wonrsquot be the first time that the United States has had to struggle with energy insecurity. The shale revolution completely and totally redrew the worldrsquos geopolitical map, but that was a relatively recent occurrence. Before that, the United States was more or less beholden to the Middle East, and those relations were tumultuous to say the least. Twice in one decade -- first in 1973 and then again in 1979 -- consumers in the United States found themselves in long gas lines thanks to an oil embargo and the Iranian Revolution, respectively. A gush of domestic shale oil and gas in recent decades completely changed the rules of engagement, giving the country ldquoa flexibility in international affairs that it had not had for decades.rdquonbspBut the geopolitical power of the shale revolution is fading at a rapid pace. Shale has been pronounced dead many times over as production has waned as shale wells age and the ldquodrill, baby, drillrdquo zeitgeist begins to temper itself. And all that was before the sector all but ground to a halt thanks to the spread of the novel coronavirus. Last year, as industrial sectors took a break, people retreated inside to shelter in place, and the global demand for oil dipped, the West Texas Intermediate crude benchmark plummeted to nearly $40 below zero in April.nbsp  Related U.S. Shale Sees Light At The End Of The Tunnel  All of a sudden, peak oil is nearing. And while the clean energy transition can not and will not happen overnight, oil is unquestionably in its twilight years. Energy executives around the world have seen the writing on the wall. In Europe, Big Oil has begun its pivot to becoming Big Energy. In China, President Xi Jinpingrsquos administration has invested heavily in clean energy technology and infrastructure in order to shore up its own energy security and independence. In the United States, oil execs and petro-politicians have taken the opposite approach they have circled the wagons. Instead of focusing on the long-term outlook for oil, for which the prognosis is unquestionably grim, they have focused on the immediate term. Ironically, dogmatic loyalty to the shale play that granted the United States its energy independence will be the very thing that takes it away.  Yes, the world still needs hundreds of billions of barrels of oil. But that will more than likely be fossil fuelsrsquo swan song. In the near future, energy independence will have very little to do with a cheap supply of oil and gas and everything to do with getting into clean energy markets early and fighting global warming. Climate change poses an enormous threat to energy security and geopolitical turmoil will undoubtedly intensify as the world gets warmer. Whatrsquos more, clean energy relies on long and complex supply chains that include components like rare Earth metals and minerals, and the countries that control those supply chains will be the new energy titans. So far, the United States is falling far, far behind in that race. As it stands, China controls the supply of as much as 90% of some of these finite materials.nbsp  The United States has given oil and gas free rein for far too long and failed to diversify its energy mix in the process, making the country particularly vulnerable in a global market that it has increasingly less control over.nbsp  The United Statesrsquo failure to get on board the clean energy train has not only imperiled its energy security, but also its national security. ldquoAs climate change continues to destabilize at-risk regions worldwide, threatening to draw the United States into more protracted, international conflicts,rdquo Foreign Policy reported this week, ldquothe administration needs to do more to treat climate change as a matter of national security rather than as just an environmental concernmdashand to move toward true energy independence in the process.rdquo  By Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.com",-1,0.9991,"['energy', 'United', 'oil', 'States', 'shale', 'security', 'clean', ' ', 'independence', 'gas', 'global']"
Mercedes To Bet $47 Billion On An Electric Future,2021-07-25T10:00:00-05:00,"One by one, the world's auto manufacturers have made bold commitments to electric vehicles, setting targets for turning over their entire fleets and disclosing large capital expenditure plans for the future.  Today, it looks like it's Mercedesrsquo turn.  The luxury auto manufacturer has said this morning it is going to spend more than $47 billion over the next 10 years to electrify its lineup and defend its position as the worldrsquos best-selling luxury-car maker through a historic industry transformation, according to Bloomberg.  Mercedes says it'll launch 3 new EV platforms in 2025 and that it is going to build 8 additional battery factories with partners.nbsp  Chief Executive Officer Ola Kallenius said ldquoThe tipping point is getting closer and we will be ready as markets switch to electric-only by the end of this decade. This step marks a profound reallocation of capital.rdquo  Mercedes's first foray into EVs with the EQS was a resounding success, as the vehicle drew praise from analysts and car reviewers alike.  Investors will be happy to hear that Mercedes says it is sticking with its profitability targets despite the shift. Mercedes is forecast to be more profitable in 2021 than itrsquos been in years, Bloomberg reported. The current tailwind has been a result of higher-margin models mixed with increased post-Covid demand.  Related Extreme Flooding Weighs On Chinarsquos Energy Supply Chain  However, like Stellantis did earlier this week, Mercedes warned about headwinds coming from raw material prices rising.

Climate Friendly Banks The Key To A Sustainable Energy Transformation,2021-07-24T14:00:00-05:00,"Amid an increased focus on environmental sustainability, the idea of fossil fuel ldquobad banksrdquo is gaining traction globally. The concept refers to special companies specifically dedicated to acquiring and winding down fossil fuel assets.  As renewable energy becomes cheaper, more investors around the world are turning their backs on fossil fuels, and coal in particular, which is increasingly seen as high-risk relative to other energy projects.  Citibank, for example, recently announced that it will stop financing thermal coal mining, with a view to eliminating its credit exposure entirely by 2030 elsewhere, Deutsche Bank has pledged to cut ties with companies that make more than half their revenue from coal mining by 2025.  Related Clash Of the Energy Titans Oil vs. Solar  A report published this year by the University of Oxford found that coal mining loan volumes were down 90% in Europe and 57% in ASEAN over the past decade, although they decreased by just 11% and 23%, respectively, in North America and Australia, and remained stable in China.  In this sense, with the global energy sector rapidly decarbonising, coal could be the canary in the mine. ldquoIf these observed trends continue and we see the cost of capital for oil and gas go the way of coal, this could have very significant implications for the economics of oil and gas projects around the world. This could result in stranded assets and introduce substantial re-financing risks,rdquo the report stated.  For now, companies are primarily seeking to offload their coal projects. This has given rise to calls to guarantee that such assets be handled appropriately, and not simply moved off balance sheet.  Bad banks to the rescue  The term bad bank first emerged in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when big banks created smaller, separate entities to absorb their toxic, subprime assets, sanitising their balance sheets and winding down these assets.  Earlier this year BlackRock's CEO, Larry Fink, proposed that a similar model could be used to help companies divest from fossil fuel assets.  Fink rehearsed his ideas at the G20 meetings in July, at which Mark Carney, the UNrsquos special envoy for climate, announced that Fink was working with Jane Fraser, CEO of Citibank, and Oliver Baumlte, CEO of Allianz, on the issue.  For Fink, the wholesale divestiture of dirty assets could lead to ldquogreenwashingrdquo, as there is no guarantee that the private entity that buys them would manage them correctly.  Indeed, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie estimates that since 2018 oil majors such as ExxonMobil and Total have sold almost $30bn of such assets to private companies, with a further $140bn currently for sale.  While such transactions help companies meet their climate change targets, there is no guarantee that they help reduce emissions. There are widely held concerns that purchasing entities aim to extract as much value as possible from the assets, with little concern for environmental consequences, and face much less scrutiny than prominent multinationals.  Related The Renewable Energy Waste Crisis Is Much Worse Than You Think  By contrast, a climate bad bank would hive off the fossil fuel-related aspects of a given companyrsquos portfolio, freeing it to concentrate on other, cleaner lines of business, while at the same time being assured that the asset would be dismantled responsibly.  For now, the idea has gained the most traction in relation to coal. But if oil and gas does indeed go the way of coal, then this model could be expanded to cover all fossil fuels, as Fink proposed.  Another function of bad banks is to shoulder the costs of clean-up once the asset has been closed.  Such clean-ups often involve significant outlays. For example, Australia-headquartered mining company South32 is in the process of transferring its South Africa Energy Coal unit to mining group Seriti Resources. As part of the deal, South32 will pay $200m over a decade to help finance environmental clean-up, and a further $50m to restructure some loss-making sites.  Notably, when the deal was first floated in 2019 Seriti Resources was slated to pay $6.7m, in addition to deferred payments based on future cash flow, capped at $101.5m per year. Since then, however, the deferred payment plan has been dropped, and South32 has agreed to accept a nominal fee for the sites.  First steps  A major step towards a new era of coal-related bad banks came in May, when Citigroup and Trafigura, a commodity trading company, proposed the creation of a fund that would operate on the model of a bad bank.  The vehicle ndash called Coal to Zero ndash will buy up mines and run them for a profit until 2045 the project is being pitched as an ldquoenergy transition vehicle focused on global decarbonisation by acquiring, responsibly operating and retiring coal assets significantly before the end of their mineable liferdquo.  According to Citigroup, Coal to Zero ldquoaims to deploy private capital to support an orderly exit from coal in a way that is fair to the people and communities impacted. In doing so, it intends to generate a positive, measurable environmental and social impact alongside a financial return for investorsrdquo.  While such proposals are seen as a step in the right direction, some doubts have also been voiced. Foremost among these is that the completion year of 2045 is beyond the date by which emissions have to be considerably reduced in order to avoid substantial climate change.  Although the concept of a safe and timely phasing out of coal mining is front and centre, there are a number of steps still to be taken before such a vision can become a reality ndash and crucially, one which is not vulnerable to accusations of greenwashing.

VC Firms Are Pouring Billions Of Dollars Into Green Tech,2021-07-22T17:00:00-05:00,"ESG investing it's in every media outlet and on every bank's business plan. A rush to what many call alignment of values with investment goals has led to a flourishing new industry with funds popping up like mushrooms after the rain. Green-tech startups are the new dotcoms, it seems, and the danger of a bubble seems distantmdashfor now.  Interestingly enough, things were very different just a few years ago, as the Wall Street Journal's Scott Patterson noted in a recent article. The past decade, he wrote, saw a pullout of investors from the green energy technology field after a couple of notable demisesmdashone of solar company Solyndra back in 2011 and one of battery maker A123 Systems a year later.  From today's standpoint, this is ancient history. Now, hardly a week goes by without a breakthrough of some sort in batteries, solar power tech, or, say, hydrogen. Most of these breakthroughs have to do with cost and efficiency, which are the two things that can guarantee a product a long life. Yet, most of these breakthroughs never make it to the consumer. They never make the leap across the so-called valley of death between the lab and the market. Especially if funding is scarce and hard to come by.  Venture capital funds are changing this, the WSJ's Patterson writes, citing data from PitchBook, a private capital market research provider. According to PitchBook, venture capital funds are seen completing $7.7 billion worth of green tech deals this year, which would be up from $1 billion ten years ago.  nbsp    It's not just venture capitalists, either. JP Morgan earlier this month launched not one but three new sustainability investment funds. This was only the latest move in a rush to set up clean energy investment funds to take advantage of growing investor appetite for environmental, social, and governance, commonly known as ESG, investing.  Demand for new investment opportunities by a new generation of investors is one driver of this trend. Another, more important driver is government support for low-carbon technology. The European Union has tied its post-pandemic recovery funding program to commitments by national governments to invest a solid portion of the funds in low-carbon energy. This is effectively an open invitation to anyone doing anything in green tech. The Biden administration has also opened up the U.S. federal purse for green tech startups.  Now, the EU and the U.S. are discussing something they are calling a green technology alliance. In a joint statement, the two said, We intend to lead by example through becoming net-zero greenhouse gases GHG economies no later than 2050 and implementing our respective enhanced 2030 targets.  With such solid support, investment in green tech has become a lot less risky for investors... except in the part where a technology simply has no chances of survival as happens to an awful lot of breakthroughs that sound so groundbreaking in the lab but never cross the valley of death. However, this is a risk inherent in any startup investment.  We've seen some instances of this risk materializing in the EV space recently. First, EV and hydrogen vehicle startup Nikola suffered a major share price drop when a report from a short-seller revealed that the company's CEO had overstated the company's progress on its flagship model. The revelation cost Nikola a huge deal with GM, too. Another EV maker, Lordstown, recently teetered on the brink of collapse as the company ran out of money before it started commercial production of its Endurance truck.  Many more startups, not just in the EV space but also in other green tech fields, will go under if their products don't live up to the hype. But at least now they have access to abundant funding, unlike a few years ago. Then, it was a buyers' market. Now, it's a sellers' market, and buyers are lining up, eager to take part in the energy transition. How long before the situation escalates into a bubble That would depend on how many more Solyndras and A123 Systems there are out there.

Net-Zero 2050 May Need Up To $173 Trillion Investments,2021-07-22T11:00:00-05:00,"The world will need to invest up to $173 trillion in greener energy infrastructure and supply over the next 30 years if it wants to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, BloombergNEF said in its New Energy Outlook 2021 report published on Wednesday.  If governments and companies want to see the coveted 2050 net-zero emissions they have been racing to pledge in recent months, they would need to invest between $92 trillion and $173 trillion in the next three decades, according to BNEF.  The energy transition that would be compatible with a net-zero world in 2050 would need rapid scaling of investment, the research firm says, adding that ldquothe route to net-zero remains yet uncertain.rdquo nbsp  According to BNEF, the world needs to more than double yearly investments in order to achieve net-zero emissions. Those investments should jump from around $1.7 trillion annually at present to ldquosomewhere between $3.1 trillion and $5.8 trillion per year on average over the next three decades.rdquo  BNEF believes that this decade will be critical to set the world on a track that could allow it to reach the Paris Agreement targets.  ldquoThere is no time to waste. If the world is to achieve or get close to meeting net-zero by mid-century, then we need to accelerate deployment of the low-carbon solutions we have this decade ndash that means even more wind, solar, batteries, and electric vehicles, as well as heat pumps for buildings, recycling and greater electricity use in industry, and redirecting biofuels to shipping and aviation,rdquo BNEF chief economist Seb Henbest said. nbsp  Capital expenditures will create opportunities for investors and financial institutions, BNEF says, but didnrsquot specify who will foot the enormous bill.  If the world is to come anywhere close to limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius or below, it will need, collectively, a bare minimum of $30 trillion to $40 trillion of investment in energy systems and decarbonization of industries where emissions are notoriously hard to abate such as steel and cement making.

Biomass The EU's Great 'Clean Energy' Fraud,2021-07-13T18:00:00-05:00,"The professionalization of the biomass industry is a problem that needs attention.--Bas Eickhout, Dutch politician and member of the European Parliament.  When it comes to the global shift to low-carbon energy sources, Europe has traditionally been viewed as the world leader while the United States has frequently been regarded as an important, albeit grudging, participant. Over the past half-decade, China has also improved its stock in the fast-growing market through a plethora of heavy investments, especially in solar and wind.  For the most part, those views appear merited Renewables rose to generate 38% of Europe's electricity in 2020 compared to 34.6% in 2019, marking the first time renewables overtook fossil-fired generation, which fell to 37%. In contrast, the IEA estimates that natural gas and coal generated a combined 61% of electricity in the United States in 2020, with renewables accounting for just 20%.  Earlier this year, the EU earned extra bragging rights after renewable energy surpassed the use of fossil fuels on the continent for the first time in history.  In contrast, the United States' standing in the energy transition cycle took a significant hit after former president Donald Trump fulfilled a key campaign pledge by withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate agreement, joining the likes of Syria and Nicaragua as the only countries not party to the agreement.  But maybe Europe is not as clean as it has made the world believemdashand the United States is not as dirty.  In 2009, the European Union issued a Renewable Energy Directive RED, pledging to curb greenhouse gas emissions and urging its member states to shift from fossil fuels to renewables. But the fine print provided a major loophole the EU classified biomass as a renewable energy source, on par with wind and solar power.nbsp  Following the directive, EU governments have been incentivizing energy providers to burn biomass instead of coal, driving up huge demand for wood.  In fact, the EU has been importing so much biomass from the American South that it has emerged as Europe's primary source of biomass imports.  It turns out that for more than a decade, European power plants have merely been reducing their carbon footprint on paper by outsourcing their footprint to the United States.  United Nations Loophole  Back in 1996, the United Nations UN devised a method to measure global carbon emissions. In a bid to simplify the process and avoid double counting, UN scientists suggested that biomass emissions should be calculated where the trees are cut down, not where the wood pellets are burned.  The UN adopted this methodology in its Renewable Energy Directive, allowing energy companies to burn biomass produced in the United States without having to report the emissions.  The UN was clearly more concerned about the amount of carbon we are putting out into the atmosphere regardless of the source. This source-agnostic approach has, however, nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp nbspbeen creating a lot of controversy amongst policymakers, advocates, and scientistsmdashand now the investment community.nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp  I can't think of anything that harms nature more than cutting down trees and burning them, William Moomaw, professor emeritus of international environmental policy at Tufts University, has told CNN.nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp  It doesn't change the physical reality. A law designed to reduce emissions that in reality encourages an increase in emissions hellip has to be flawed, Tim Searchinger, senior research scholar at Princeton University, has told CNN, referring to Europe's directive.    According to Bas Eickhout, Dutch politician and member of the European Parliament, The idea was to curb our addiction to fossil fuels. Biomass was an attractive option for EU countries at the time, he explained, because it was much cheaper than solar or wind power and could be mixed in when burning coal. But the production of biomass has become an industrial process which means something has gone fundamentally wrong. The professionalization of the biomass industry is a problem that needs attention.nbsp  Eickhout says European decision-makersnbsp were too naiumlve and didn't fully consider the repercussions of importing biomass.  Following the EU loophole, 164 acres of North Carolina's state's forests are cut down by the biomass industry every day. North Carolina's Clean Energy Plan acknowledges that most of the wood pellets produced in the state are exported to Europe but does nothing to advance the state's clean energy economy. Prominent players in the trade are Drax and Enviva, which have acquired and are developing wood pellet plants in the American South.  Luckily for investors, the US clean energy landscape has just gotten a lot more competitive.  Just months after president Biden rejoined the Paris Climate accord, global energy market navel-gazer IHS Markit has ranked the United States as the most attractive market for renewable energy investments in the world.  The United States has claimed the top spot on the latest IHS Markit Global Renewables Markets Attractiveness Rankings mainly on account of sound market fundamentals and the availability of an attractivemdashalthough phasing downmdashsupport scheme. The survey tracks attractiveness for investment for non-hydro renewables such as solar PV, offshore wind, and onshore wind. The ranking evaluates each country on the basis of seven subcategories that include market fundamentals, current policy framework, infrastructure readiness, investor friendliness, revenue risks, and return expectations, easiness to compete, and the overall opportunity size for each market.  As expected, Europe dominates the top echelons, with Germany coming in at 2, France 4, Spain 5, and the Netherlands at 9. China has been ranked the third-best market for renewable energy investors, while India is 6, Australia 7, Japan 8, and Brazil 10.  Wind and solar power capacity expanded rapidly in 2020, with BP Plc. NYSEBP reporting in its annual Statistical Review of World Energy that the two sectors recorded a colossal 238 GW increase in installed capacity last year mostly at the expense of coal-fired generation, which fell 4.4%, easily one of its largest annual declines on record. However, BP warns that the impressive growth could merely be transitory due to the effects of the pandemic and says the world still needs tangible, concrete differences to meet climate targets.

The Predatory Green Energy Trap That Could Spark Another Housing Crisis,2021-07-03T10:00:00-05:00,"Itrsquos been over a decade since 10 million people in the United States lost their homes in the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis. Over a decade since the financial devastation set in motion by the housing crash caused a recession which destroyed over $30 trillion of the worldrsquos wealth and 5,000 suicides in Europe and North America alone. Over a decade since the banks, bankers, and Wall Street CEOs who caused the housing bubble to fill and then burst from the whiplash momentum of their own greed got government bailouts and walked away virtually scot-free. And apparently, thatrsquos more than enough time for us to forget any lessons learned and dangerously toy with housing markets all over again.  The next housing crisis could be caused by a predatory and poorly planned government-funded scheme that encourages United States residents with low incomes to participate in a clean energy loan program that uses their houses as collateral. On the surface, this clean energy infrastructure program, called the Property Assessed Clean Energy program, PACE for short, seems like a great deal built on even greater ideals. The idea is to allow people who could otherwise not afford to install solar panels or otherwise retrofit their homes to be more environmentally friendly to do so by participating in a government loan program that is paid back in property taxes.nbsp    While this sounds like a worthy endeavor, there is a fundamental problem with this model in a frightening callback to the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, the crux of the issue is providing loans to people who, quite simply, cannot afford them. And, like in 2008, a lot of people are at risk of losing their homes while those who sold them a bill of goods walk away with a paycheck.nbsp  PACE has now been the subject of hard-hitting takedowns by the investigative journalism nonprofit ProPublica and Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. The exposeacutes tell the stories of dozens of low-income home owners who were talked into signing up for the government program without being fully made aware of the significant risk of losing their house at auction if they were to default on loan payments. These payments take the form of increased property taxes, which in some cases ballooned astronomically as a product of PACE compliance.nbsp  One Missouri woman, Diana Thomas, in exchange for a new furnace and four small basement windows, saw her taxes go from $247 to $1,465 and total loan payments, after interest, of $18,200 -- more than the cost of her entire two-story home at the time that she took the loan, which was appraised at $16,226 by the county. Thomas is now years behind on those payments, which the professional setting her up for the loan would have been more than aware she could not pay, and at risk of losing her home.nbsp  Thomas is far from alone. Through PACE, homeowners in already marginalized or vulnerable communities across the nation were told, by door-to-door PACE salesmen, that they could make their homes more eco-friendly a win-win for them and the government without putting up any money up front, only to be hit by taxes higher than they could possibly pay -- again, the whole point of this program is that it targets low-income individuals and families -- and then putting those people at risk of losing their homes, even if those homeowners had never even been late on a mortgage payment.nbsp  ldquoBy marketing their programs to people who need urgent repairs but have few options for credit, critics contend they have disproportionately burdened some of the statersquos most vulnerable homeowners,rdquo the Missouri Independent reported this week. The negative impacts of PACE have furthermore disproportionately impacted ldquoborrowers in predominantly Black neighborhoods.rdquo  After these predatory practices gained attention in the media, especially in the state of Missouri where Thomas lives and about 3,000 other homeowners participated in PACE, wersquore finally starting to see some signs of reform. Just this Tuesday, Missouri Governor Mike Parson signed new legislation imposing much-needed consumer protections within PACE, which would set requirements for giving signees full information of the risks of the program as well as capping the loan amount based on the housersquos appraisal value.nbsp  While this is positive news, itrsquos still too little too late for those who have already lost or are in the process of losing their homes, and those who are still vulnerable to predatory PACE practices in other states. John Oliver, in his searing segment, questioned whether PACE was worth reforming at all, considering that there are plenty of other options for low-income homeowners to secure affordable green energy upgrades from organizations and programs with decidedly less slimy track records.nbsp  But the most worrying aspect of PACE isnrsquot that itrsquos uniquely sinister or predatory -- itrsquos that these traits arenrsquot unique at all. In 2008 we saw exactly how far, wide, and deep these kinds of problems can extend. PACE wonrsquot cause the kind of widespread damage that we saw 13 years ago, but it shows that another such crisis is uncomfortably within the realm of possibility.nbsp  By Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.com",-1,-0.9853,"['PACE', ' ', 'loan', 'program', 'people', 'homes', '$', 'government', 'losing', 'homeowners', '2008']"
Imagining The City Of The Future,2021-07-01T14:00:00-05:00,"Cities and municipalities can be the most effective policy executors. Being closer to their citizens and having more cohesive populations than nation-states helps them rally residents for challenging endeavors. Cities also adapt more easily to new digital tools, utilising data to monitor public sentiment and sharpen outreach efforts. These attributes allow cities and municipalities to act swiftly in normal times and in crises.  Climate change and the city  Cities address climate change individually and as part of a governance ecosystem. They work with national governments and international institutions to affect climate goals, but above all, cities strive for ensuring livability for their residents against climate impacts. One report on the UNrsquos Sustainable Development Goals lauds smart citiesmdashwhich use data to enhance public service provisionmdashas key drivers for achieving net-zero emissions by maximising energy efficiency, streamlining public transport, and monitoring air quality.  Areas where cities can enhance sustainability include  Mobility Cities may promote bicycle and scooter use by building segregated bike paths. They might also offer bike rentals, increase shuttles to transport hubs and initiate walkability programmes. Moreover, cities could electrify urban vehicle fleets by subsidizing car purchases through deals with car companies.  Energy efficiency Cities can curtail energy consumption through smart building programmes. They may provide tax breaks and subsidies for building renovations and incentivise domestic generation sources like solar panels and geothermal pumps. Cities might also implement green building codes, exemplified by Brusselrsquos Passive House Standard.  Green growth The urban green transition could bolster growth and provide payoffs at the national level. According to the OECD, green urban growth could lower the costs associated with national environmental targets through improved transportation and land-use. A World Economic Forum report suggests such initiatives can attract multinational firms committed to net-zero targets.  How cities go green  Certain conditions are required for cities to flourish within the climate governance ecosystem  Clear objectives Each city must consider its unique set of circumstances, factoring demographics, geography, development level, culture, and national climate objectives when setting sustainability goals. Only with clear and feasible goals will meaningful climate progress be measured.nbsp  Political will Lacking political will, complex and costly sustainability programmes are impossible. Cities will therefore seek to make the climate agenda a recurring theme of public discourse by integrating green programmes into daily urban life, becoming part of the culture of a city.  Related The Best Energy Dividend Stocks Of 2021  Budgeting Sustainability objectives require adequate funding. Cities will therefore cultivate partners at higher levels of governance to ensure the resources at their disposal match their climate ambitions.  Obstacles to urban sustainability  A report by the World Economic Forum suggests the rosy picture of urban climate mitigation is incompletemdashconfined to a few large, wealthy cities in North America, Europe, and Chinamdashoverlooking failures particularly among the cities of South and Southeast Asia. Another study warns a lack of coordination between national authorities and other stakeholders will cause urban sustainability initiatives to fail in Malaysia, Indonesia, and India, risking that these cities ldquowill lock in more fully to high-cost, high-carbon development paths.rdquo  A success story  One Southeast Asian city which bucked the trend through the adroit application of the above prerequisites was Bandar Lampung in Indonesia. Bandar Lampung leveraged a cities network to inform its sustainability plans by conducting a series of learning dialogues with officials from other cities, NGOs, and universities. This process secured the political will to form a multi-stakeholder team responsible for assessing climate risks and prioritising adaptation strategies.  Being within the governance ecosystem  How cities cooperate with other governing actors will be critical to combating climate change. What cities can offer the governance ecosystem are its data capabilities, deft policy execution, and responsiveness to change.  Cities rely on national governments for funding and must execute sustainability initiatives in line with national goals. But cities often have the leeway to go further than national governments, especially where national climate action is lacking.  Related Exxon Sting Reveals Black Book Of Senators  The relationship between cities and national governments goes both ways, with cities providing governments with data on climate policy implementation. When national policy encounters difficulties, local data can uncover causes and suggest policy modifications.  International organizations furnish cities with policy guidance and facilitate information networks that disseminate models of successful policy implementation. Examples include the OECDrsquos Green Cities Programme, which measures green economic growth in cities the UN Environment Programmersquos Climate Neutral Network, which convenes local and national governments for discussions on climate change and the EUrsquos Urban Agenda, which develops citiesrsquo capabilities for addressing climate impacts.nbsp  International institutions also provide fora for cities to advance climate initiatives. Independent of national governments, such organisations can push cities to act unilaterally against climate change. For example, the city of Haifa joined the Paris Climate Accord in response to Israelrsquos slow implementation of that agreement. Working closely with the mayor of Paris, Haifarsquos mayor declared ldquocities have the power to lead change, without waiting for it to come from the central government.rdquo  Looking ahead  Cities will be major players in climate action because of their ability to rapidly execute policy, craft effective public outreach, and employ data. To further advance their role in climate mitigation, they must also articulate clear objectives, account for local circumstances, and identify potential challenges.  To improve climate action, cities will seek to broaden their network of partners at the local, national and international levels, looking for data-based feedback from all governance levels as a guide.  By leveraging their place in the governance ecosystem to maximise policy options, cities could play an outsized role in achieving global sustainability objectives and turning the climate challenge into a growth opportunity. Understanding their limitations, however, will dramatically enhance those prospects.

Why Lithium Prices Could Soon Return To Record Highs,2021-06-28T17:00:00-05:00,"Lithium producers are adding new production capacity to meet booming demand for the critical metal as the world pushes for greener energy.nbsp  Suppliers of the key mineral have turned quite optimistic this year that global demand for lithium will soar in the coming decades with the increased uptake of electric vehicles EVs and battery storage.nbsp  Surging demand is set to drive lithium prices higher, lithium producers say in an outlook on the industry that turned decisively bullish this year.nbsp  One of the largest lithium suppliers in the world, Chinarsquos Ganfeng Lithium, is not ruling out the possibility that lithium prices could recover from the two-year decline and reach the record-highs seen in 2018.nbsp  Lithium prices have already surged this year from the lows of 2019-2020. But suppliers believe prices have a lot more room to rise as the push for green energy is overwhelming government agendas worldwide.nbsp  ldquoThe industry is rapidly growing and we have a very upbeat forecast on lithium consumption,rdquo Ganfeng Lithiumrsquos vice chairman Wang Xiaoshen told Bloomberg in an interview last week.nbsp  Related Solar Has An Unlikely New Enemy  ldquoI canrsquot rule out the possibility for lithium prices to bounce back to the 2018 level,rdquo the executive added.nbsp  Ganfeng Lithium said earlier this year that it ldquois optimistic about the long-term development of the global lithium market,rdquo and announced it would expand its production capacity.nbsp  ldquoChinarsquos Ganfeng Lithium has announced considerable plans to extend its reach in the lithium supply chain throughout the first half of 2021, remaining one of the most active players in targeting large commitments to build out its production capabilities,rdquo Benchmark Mineral Intelligence said in a report last week.nbsp  The companyrsquos vice chairman, however, is not ruling out another dip in lithium prices either, in the interview with Bloomberg. This could happen, he says, if the uptake of EV sales slows down or if major lithium producers bring much more supply faster than expected.nbsp  For now, though, it seems that analysts concur that lithium has a bright future, especially considering the net-zero emission commitments from dozens of industrialized nations and blocs, including the United States and the European Union.nbsp  Lithium demand for batteries for EVs and battery energy storage is set to jump until 2050mdashthe net-zero watershed moment for most countries.nbsp  Lithium mined for batteries accounted for just 9 percent of all lithium produced back in 2000. But by 2020, the share of lithium produced for batteries had surged to 66 percent and is set to further jump to account for more than 90 percent of all lithium applications by 2030, according to estimates from IHS Markit.nbsp  ldquoWe continue to see strong market demand for lithium, especially from EVs,rdquo Kent Masters, CEO at the biggest lithium producer in the world, Albemarle Corporation, said on the Q1 earnings call last month.  ldquoWersquore fighting to keep up with demand. I think the industry is doing the same,rdquo he added.  Eric Norris, president for Albemarlersquos Lithium division, noted that ldquoWe see price rising going forward for the foreseeable future.rdquo  As per Rystad Energy estimates, the EV surge could lead to ldquoa serious lithium supply deficit already from 2027.rdquo The industry needs to approve very soon new lithium mining projects so that supply has a chance to catch up with demand.nbspnbsp  ldquoWe anticipate that lithium prices could replicate their past turbulence if supplies cannot catch up with booming EV demand later this decade. Looking at the significant task ahead to build more mining capacity, prices could even triple as a result of the market imbalance,rdquo said James Ley, Senior Vice President at Rystad Energyrsquos Energy Metals team.nbsp  According to the International Energy Agency IEA, the rise of clean energy technologies ldquois set to supercharge demand for critical minerals.rdquo Lithium demand could jump by over 40 times by 2040 in the agencyrsquos Sustainable Development Scenario, a pathway aligned with the world achieving the Paris Agreement goals.nbspnbsp  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com",1,0.9903,"[' ', 'lithium', 'Lithium', 'demand', 'prices', 'rdquo', 'world', 'year', 'set', 'industry', 'Ganfeng']"
Germany Takes The Lead In Pivotal Year For Hydrogen,2021-06-28T12:00:00-05:00,"Announcements of large new electrolyser projects, and the formation of consortia to build them, are appearing in the news almost daily. What began as a few announcements a year ago is now reaching a crescendo.nbsp  The growing number of projects would indicate that capacity to produce green hydrogen will increase sharply in the next few years. Indeed, according to recent report of the International Renewable Energy Agency IRENA, entitled lsquoGreen Hydrogen Supply, A Guide to Policy Making,rsquo electrolyser manufacturing capacity worldwide is expected to rise to 3.1GW per year by the end of 2021.nbspnbsp  Should this ramp up occur it will mark an impressive gain on current capacity. But it pales in comparison to what IRENA says is needed. According to that agency, global manufacturing capacity of 130-160GW per year will be needed for a carbon-free economy, in order to achieve total installed electrolyser capacity of 5TW producing some 400 million metric tons Mt of green hydrogen annually in 2050.nbsp  The challenge is daunting but signs are on the horizon that a take-off could occur. It will bear watching whether the current news bubble extends into a steady stream or, as has happened in decades past with hydrogen, fizzles out.nbsp  A good explosionnbsp  Hydrogenrsquos leap forward started last summer. It was just last June when Germany announced a ldquoNational Hydrogen Strategyrdquo to create a domestic market with 5GW of renewable energy dedicated to hydrogen production by 2030. The same month, Germany signed a cooperative agreement with Morocco to develop a 100MW green hydrogen facility in the North African country.nbsp  A month later the EU announced its lsquoHydrogen strategy for a climate-neutral Europe,rsquo setting the ambitious target of 6GW of hydrogen electrolysis to produce close to 1 Mt annually by 2024 and 40GW of electrolysis capacity producing 10 Mt by 2030.nbsp  News of the first real megaproject came almost simultaneously. In July the Helios Green Fuels project was announced with an intention to deploy 4GW of renewable power to produce 650 metric tons of hydrogen per day, supporting the production of 1.2 Mt of ammonia annually at the planned NEOM city in Saudi Arabia with production to begin in 2025.nbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp  Related The Dawn Of A New Era For U.S. Shale  In a year, the world for hydrogen has completely changed, with announced projects rising from MW to double-digit GW-scale. A recent listing has 22 major projects of 1GW or greater at various locations around the world. Another has 34 lsquohydrogen valleys,rsquo where production, storage, distribution and final use are in one area of relatively close proximity.nbsp  The concept of hydrogen valleys appears in a new report, lsquoThe Potential for Green Hydrogen in the GCC Region,rsquo by Dubai-based think tank Dii Desert Energy and the consultancy Roland Berger. The 34 are in different stages of development worldwide, with more than 20 in Europe, others in Australia, China, Japan, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Chile, and the US.nbsp  ldquoYou can add more specific large-scale projects for the production of green hydrogen/molecules in countries like Mauritania, Morocco, Egypt,rdquo says Cornelius Matthes, CEO of the Dubai-based think tank Dii Desert Energy.nbsp    ldquoThere has been a huge explosion of announcements since last year which is generally good for the market,rdquo he adds.nbsp  Matthes cautions that many of the projects are at a very early stage, conceptual, without clear paths to funding. Still the growing list is significant.nbsp  ldquoIt creates the right momentum, the right fantasy,rdquo says Matthes. ldquoIt shows hydrogen will have a major role in the energy transition.rdquo  Gray to green filling the gapnbsp  Matthesrsquo cautious optimism about the recent spate of project announcements is abetted by what he perceives as an important transition now occurring. An earlier phase of planning and testing is giving way to actual development of projects for market, as evidenced by new kinds of creative investment programs beginning to appear.nbsp  He points to the recent launch of the German governmentrsquos H2Global Foundation, a market-oriented funding program that is focused on the development of hydrogen for export in lsquopartner countriesrsquo.nbsp  The new foundation, governed by a special independent H2Global Commission with 16 founding members, is a vehicle to create a market-based mechanism, acting as offtaker to help develop international markets. It is working with EUR 900 million funding provided by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy BMWi.  Related U.S. Shale Producers Stick To Output Discipline  ldquoItrsquos an announcement of extreme relevance,rdquo says Matthes. ldquoIt is basically a vehicle to support the creation of a market in general, overcoming the financing gaps between gray and green hydrogen via lsquoContracts for Difference.rsquordquo  The concept is to bring supply and demand together by covering the difference between the purchase and selling prices for green hydrogen and hydrogen-derived products. It creates an intermediary, the Hydrogen Intermediary Network Company HINT.CO, which deploys a funding mechanism based on the lsquoContracts for Differencersquo approach, in which the lowest offer price and the highest selling price are each awarded the contract, making the price difference to be compensated as small as possible.  HINT.CO will use this lsquodouble auctionrsquo mechanism and compensate for the difference between the supply and demand prices, making it possible for buyers to integrate green hydrogen and derivatives into their operations at market-reflective prices. The auctions will be targeted in countries that can supply Germany and the EU with renewable energy and hydrogen.nbsp  Programs such as this, with targeted funds that level the field for investment in green hydrogen generation capacities, are what distinguish the H2Global concept from previous investment promotion programs, which primarily enabled the development and testing of technologies. They may come to play a critical role as mechanisms to support regional auctions of green molecules, not unlike the auctions that have been instrumental to ensuring competition-based prices on both buy and sell sides in utility-scale solar and wind power development.nbspnbsp  Matthes thinks the market-based aspect will help emerging hydrogen markets to avoid the kind of overpayment that occurred with feed-in tariffs in Europe.nbspnbsp  He compares this moment with that in 2009, when his organization Dii Desert Energy initially called lsquoDesertec Industrial Initiativersquo was launched as an industrial initiative in Germany to act as a unique public-private sector network. Then, its focus was to begin to explore the potential of renewables in the Middle East and North Africa and connecting local markets for green electrons to Europe. Its work reached a high point last year when, working closely with Brussels, it saw key elements of its 2 x 40GW scheme which was developed in partnership with industry group Hydrogen Europe integrated into the EUrsquos new hydrogen strategy.  Home grown hydrogennbsp  While the governmentrsquos H2Global Foundation will apply unique financial mechanisms to foster green hydrogen for import, there is much debate in Germany over how much non-carbon hydrogen green or blue can be produced domestically. Industry groups have been calling for public support to spur production and the government now appears ready to pour direct subsidies into projects in the homeland.nbsp  The countryrsquos EUR 9 billion national hydrogen strategy, announced a year ago, includes EUR 7 billion for national projects and EUR 2 billion for international projects out of which the EUR 900 million H2Global is funded. In fact the government is already committing to more than this.nbsp  In May, the BMWi and the federal ministry of transport and digital infrastructure BMVI selected 62 hydrogen production and infrastructure projects. The government was careful to name these as Important Projects of Common European Interest IPCEI, to gain EU clearance and open the way for EUR 8 billion $9.6 billion of national subsidies.nbsp  The 8bn is expected to spur overall investment of some EUR 30 billion for projects that will cover the entire value chain, from hydrogen generation and transport to industrial applications.nbsp  The list includes electrolyser projects with a combined capacity of over 2GW and hydrogen pipelines of 1,700 km in length. There are 12 projects in the mobility sector for development and production of fuel cell systems and vehicles and for refueling infrastructure. The German energy group RWE will be involved with three of the largest projects named, developing over 400MW electrolyser capacity.nbsp  ldquoThese are not strategies anymore,rdquo says Cornelius Matthes. ldquoThese are creating the market.rdquo  And, while debate continues in Germany over the potential role of the so-called blue hydrogen with carbon capture, the Germans are currently taking a somewhat different approach from the EU as a whole, where blue hydrogen is seen as a lsquobridgersquo fuel.nbsp  ldquoIn Germany, the color is green 100%,rdquo says Matthes.nbsp  By Alan Mammoser for Oilprice.com",1,0.9991,"[' ', 'hydrogen', 'projects', 'green', 'market', 'production', 'year', 'capacity', 'Germany', 'EUR', 'says']"
Biden's Import Ban Could Break The U.S. Solar Boom,2021-06-27T14:00:00-05:00,"The U.S. Administration banned imports of material for solar panels from a Chinese company this week as America seeks to eradicate forced labor from its supply chain.nbsp  The Biden Administration says that the import ban on silica-based products from a company in China's Xinjiang region will not impact the booming U.S. solar industry. But some analysts are not so sure and think there would be negative effects on the American solar panel manufacturing supply chain.nbsp  The United States is prohibiting imports of silica-based products made by Hoshine Silicon Industry Co., Ltd., a company located in Xinjiang, and its subsidiaries. The ban is based on information reasonably indicating that Hoshine used forced labor to manufacture silica-based products, the White House said on Thursday.nbsp  The ban includes products made outside the United States that use Hoshine materials, including solar panels manufactured with polysilicon from Hoshine.nbsp  China's use of forced labor in Xinjiang is an integral part of its systematic abuses against the Uyghur population and other ethnic and religious minority groups, and addressing these abuses will remain a high priority for the Biden-Harris administration, the White House said.nbsp  China slammed the ban and accused the U.S. of trying to cripple Xinjiang's industry.nbsp  China strongly condemns the sanctions that the US imposes on Chinese companies based on lies and disinformation, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a regular press conference on Thursday.  Related Can The Middle East Survive Without Oil  From cotton to PV, from agriculture to industry, the US side uses human rights as a disguise to do all it could to cripple the industrial development in Xinjiang, he added.nbsp  The U.S. ban will not derail the Administration's clean energy targets, according to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.nbsp  Our environmental goals will not be achieved on the backs of human beings in a forced labor environment, Mayorkas said at a press briefing, as carried by Reuters.  The ban benefits U.S. firm First Solar NASDAQ FSLR, whose shares jumped from $80 on Wednesday to $86 on Thursday after the ban was announced.nbsp  Cowen amp Co analyst Jeff Osborne sees the news of the ban as a positive for First Solar given they do not use polysilicon, he said in a note cited by Bloomberg.  Roth Capital Partners, however, thinks that the ban will affect the entire supply chain in the U.S. solar industry because every importer of solar modules will have to prove that they are not importing products made with Hoshine materials.nbsp  Polysilicon analyst Johannes Bernreuter with Bernreuter Research is of the same opinion. According to Bernreuter, all eight of the world's largest polysilicon manufacturers are customers of Hoshine.nbspnbsp  A policy brief from the Peterson Institute for International Economics PIIE this month said that the Xinjiang region has a dominant global position in polysilicon, accounting for nearly half of global production.nbsp  The U.S. Solar Energy Industries Association SEIA welcomed the Biden Administration's decision to ban Hoshine-sourced solar panel materials. SEIA leads an industry-wide effort to create supply chain traceability to ensure products are not connected with forced labor in Xinjiang or anywhere else in the world.nbsp  Meanwhile, the U.S. solar industry is breaking records, installing 5 GW of new capacity in the first quarter, up by 46 percent on the year and the largest Q1 on record, the Solar Market Insight Report 2021 Q2 from SEIA and Wood Mackenzie showed.nbsp  Solar accounted for 58 percent of all new electricity-generating capacity added in the United States in Q1 2021, with wind making up most of the remainder.  Overall, the U.S. solar market surpassed 100 GWdc of installed electric generating capacity, doubling the industry's size over the last 3.5 years, WoodMac said. The consultancy expects 160 GW of solar capacity to be installed in the United States from 2021 to 2026, bringing the total installed photovoltaic solar capacity to more than 250 GW by the end of 2026.nbsp  However, the report also noted the recent jump in raw materials prices, especially for polysilicon, which is part of the U.S. ban on imports of materials sourced from Hoshine.nbsp  Compounding cost increases across all materials started at the end of Q1 and are beginning to affect installers now, the SEIA/Wood Mackenzie report said.nbsp  Surging costs across the solar value chain, coupled with the ban on Xinjiang-sourced materials for solar panels, could have a cooling effect on the hot solar market in the United States in the coming quarters.nbspnbsp  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com",0,-0.9941,"[' ', 'solar', 'ban', 'U.S.', 'Xinjiang', 'products', 'industry', 'said', 'materials', 'forced', 'labor']"
Is It Time For The Solar Industry To Look In The Mirror,2021-06-27T10:00:00-05:00,"Silicon panels pretty much rule the solar energy sector, with more than 90% of panels manufactured using the versatile element.nbsp  This is not by chance Si PV cells are cheap, robust, relatively easy to install, and perform reliably for decades.  Unfortunately, they also come with a major drawback Silicon PV panels are quite inefficient, with the most affordable models managing only 7%-16% energy efficiency depending on factors like placement, orientation, and weather conditions. Indeed, solar cells have been around for more than six decades, yet commercial silicon has barely scraped into the 25% range.nbsp  Even the much-hyped perovskite solar cells have just barely managed to break the efficiency glass ceiling, with scientists recently setting a new efficiency record for a single-junction perovskite solar cell at 25.6%. To complicate matters, sunlight is a diffuse form of energy.  This makes solar panels unsuitable for hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as steel, heavy industries, marine, and aviation.  Fortunately, concentrated solar power CSP is proving to be a viable solution for the solar power and green energy conundrum.  CSP technology employs large revolving mirror arrays, also known as heliostats, to reflect and concentrate sunlight onto a receiver. The mirrors are angled to reflect the sunlight onto a large solar receiver. This heat--also known as thermal energy--can be used to spin a turbine or power an engine to generate electricity, and also power a variety of industrial applications, including enhanced oil recovery, mineral processing, water desalination, chemical production, and food processing far from the harvesting point.  Concentrating solar-thermal power systems are generally used for utility-scale projects that can be configured in different ways, such asnbspPower tower systems that arrange mirrors around a central tower that acts as the receiver Dish-engine systems whereby mirrors are distributed over a parabolic dish surface to concentrate sunlight on a receiver fixed at the focal point, Linear systems that have rows of mirrors that concentrate the sunlight onto parallel tube receivers positioned above them or Parabolic- trough systems that use curved mirrors to focus the Sunrsquos energy onto a receiver tube that runs down the center of a trough.  CSP comes with major advantages The thermal energy concentrated in a CSP plant can be stored and used to produce electricity when it is needed--day or night--with bedrocks usually used to store the thermal power to be used to power industrial processes when the Sun goes down.  Energy 101 Concentrating Solar Power Video    Source U.S. Department of Energy  CSP might sound quite quixotic, but many readers might be surprised to find that the idea isn't particularly new--the first commercial CSP plant was developed in the 1960s. Indeed,nbsp there are 1,815 megawatts of CSP plants in operation in the United States today, enough to power about 1.5 million homes.

The fact of the matter is that in the past, CSP has not been cheap enough to implement on a massive scale.  A CSP plant operates most efficiently, and thus most cost-effectively with built-in sizes of 100 MW and higher. A typical CSP plant requires 5 to 10 acres of land per MW of capacity, with the larger acreage accommodating thermal energy storage.  Luckily, as with other conventional renewables energy technology such as solar panels and wind, CSP is now pretty close to reaching a tipping point where it will become competitive with fossil fuels in power generation costs thanks to major advances in technology.  Bill Gates-backed renewable energy outfit Heliogen is perhaps the most famous CSP startup. Heliogen has a mission to completely replace fossil fuels with solar thermal energy. What makes the company unique is that itrsquos making the process of reflecting and storing sunlight more predictable, controllable, and streamlined.  Related Rising Demand Closes The Gap Between WTI And Brent Prices  Previously, CSP companies were able to generate heat anywhere from 400 to 500 degrees centigrade. Heliogen has more than doubled that output by successfully building a solar thermal system that's capable of producing temperatures up to 1,500 degrees centigrade.nbsp  To achieve this feat, the Heliogen team employs machine learning to get the angle of the mirrors as precise as possible, down to a twentieth of a degree. All of the collected heat gets funneled down an insulated steel tube to a bed of rocks where the heat is retained as thermal energy well after the Sunsets.nbsp  Heliogen has an award-winning test facility in Lancaster, California, with 400 heliostat mirrors but says it needs to scale that up to a system with 40,000 mirrors. A few weeks ago, Heliogen managed to reel in $108m from two funding rounds to push its lsquosunlight refineryrsquo concept through to commercialization. The construction of its giant sunlight refinery will be highly automated, with robotic tractors deployed to place the heliostat foundations and set the mirrors efficiently. The companyrsquos dream is to have thousands of sunlight refineries operating across the southwest United States, Australia, and the Middle East-North Africa region by the turn of the decade.  If Heliogen manages to achieve its goal to make CSP cheaper than fossil fuels, the technology will no doubt make major waves in the manufacturing industry and help mitigate climate change.nbsp  CSP Making Fuel From Sunlight and Air  The aviation industry is one of the worst offenders as far as GHG emissions go. In fact, nbsp a one-hour flight on a twin-engine jet aircraft adds almost 19,000 pounds of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, with the global aviation industry emitting so much CO2 and other harmful greenhouse gases that if it was a country, it would rank among the top 10 emitters.  Aviation biofuels have been touted as a viable solution to curb this runaway pollution.  However, 13nbsp years since Virgin Atlantic flew a Boeing 747 between London and Amsterdam partly powered by a biofuel made from Brazilian babassu nuts and coconuts, aviation biofuels still account for less than 1% of the 1.5 billion barrels of aviation fuels 15% of global oil supply that commercial airlines burn through in a typical year.nbsp  Luckily, scientists have now developed a carbon-neutral fuel that uses the Sunrsquos energy to pull carbon dioxide from the air and turn it into fuel.  Researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology have developed a solar technology that is able to produce liquid fuels using just two ingredients solar energy and ambient air, with the resulting hydrocarbon fuels releasing only as much carbon dioxide during combustion as was previously extracted from the air thus making them carbon neutral.  It may initially seem like alchemy, but the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology has developed an elegant CSP technology whereby heliostats track the Sun, boosting the sunlightrsquos intensity by a factor of 2,500 to 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit while reflecting it onto a 50-foot-high tower.  The thermal energy heats a reactor with a core made of cerium oxide, an inexpensive compound often used to polish glass. The high temperatures lead to oxygen being liberated from the cerium, after which itrsquos mixed with water and carbon dioxide captured from the air in the reactor. As the reactor cools, the reduced cerium claws back oxygen molecules from the added material, leaving a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide called syngas. This is funneled into a second reactor, where the syngas is converted into kerosene molecules. Two years ago, the Moacutestoles refinery announced its first trickle of solar kerosene.  The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology researchers believe that with a modest boost in current efficiency, solar refineries with a heliostat array the size of Indiana could supply the entire worldrsquos jet aviation fuel demand. At the moment, solar kerosene is likely to ring up around $9 per gallon, about 3x more expensive than gasoline in the United States. But you can expect costs to fall as the technology improves in efficiency and grows in scale.nbsp  Solar kerosene will probably find a ready market.  Last year, aircraft manufacturers and other aviation organizations committed to a net-zero emissions target by 2050, effectively cutting CO2 emissions from 30 million tonnes per annum to zero despite a projected 70% increase in passenger numbers over the timeframe.  To achieve this target, they plan to use a mix of cleaner aircraft, sustainable fuels, and better air traffic management.nbsp  For aviation fuel to be considered renewable, about half of its contents must be derived from biofuels such as ethanol made from corn or wood chips.nbsp  The biggest reason why most airlines continue giving biofuels a cold shoulder is due to their higher costs. Fuel costs constitute the biggest line item for airlines, typically accounting for 22% of their overheads.nbsp  Using renewable air fuel would likely necessitate passing the extra costs to customers by increasing ticket prices, something that would not work well unless everybody did it at once because airline-specific fare changes are highly price elastic. On average, renewable jet fuels would need oil prices $65-per-barrel oil for them to become cost-competitive, a level lower than current WTI oil prices of $72 per barrel.

Are Your Solar Stocks Safe,2021-06-26T16:00:00-05:00,"A few days ago, Bloomberg reported that the Biden administration was mulling banning imports of polysilicon from Xinjiang, China, a region responsible for supplying 45% of the world's solar-grade polysilicon.  Just before leaving office, the Trump administration announced an import ban on agricultural products from Xinjiang over allegations of forced labor from detained Uighur Muslims employed in their production.nbsp  Since then, a group of bipartisan lawmakers has been pushing President Biden to move a step further and impose import restrictions on polysilicon, allowing Customs and Border Protection to seize any imports that it suspects were made with forced labor. Banning products from companies based in Xinjiang comes with considerable risk, with the likes of Nike Inc.NYSENKE, HampM and Burberry recently facing huge backlash from Chinese consumers threatening to boycott their products over statements they made regarding forced labor practices in the region.  But it appears that Biden is not about to let that deter him.  Politico has now reported that the Biden administration will go ahead and ban imports of solar materials from Xinjiang-based Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. Ltd, a major manufacturer of raw materials used in the polysilicon used in most solar panels.  Hoshine has been the subject of a report earlier this year on forced labor from Uyghur's Muslims in the global supply chain of the material in Xinjiang.  The Hoshine trade ban stops short of establishing a region-wide WRO to block imports of polysilicon from all entities in Xinjiang. However, that does not mean that more is not about to come. The CBP's usual modus operandi involves blocking imports from individual companies as it gradually builds a legal case for broader action.  Here are the key winners and losers as the Chinese situation unfolds.  Winners U.S. Solar Manufacturers  U.S. solar panel manufacturers are the biggest winners of the latest ban, and also for another key reason we will discuss shortly.  FSLRgtFirst Solar is the largest solar manufacturer in America and the Western Hemisphere and also the third-largest in the world with revenue TTM of $2.7 billion. First Solar manufactures solar panels, photovoltaic power plants, and related services, including construction, maintenance, and recycling of solar products. The Tempe, Arizona-based company employs thin film semiconductor technology to achieve enhanced efficiency and sustainability in its solar modules.nbsp  FSLR jumped 8% on Thursday trading on news of the ban, thanks to the company recently committing to building more solar panels in the United States.  Cowen analyst Jeff Osborne says the latest development is a positive for First Solar given the company does not use polysilicon and could lead to accelerating orders from utility-scale developers looking to avoid traceability issues in the future.  But that's just part of what makes this solar stock attractive right now.  Related U.S. Agrees To Lift Iran Oil Sanctions  Two weeks ago, First Solar committed to building a new 3GW per year panel factory in Ohio at a cost of $680M. The company says it seeks to reshore manufacturing that has moved outside the United States, bolstered by President Biden's ambitious clean energy goals. CEO Mark Widmar says the company's three Ohio plants combined would produce panels that could generate 6 GW of power annually by 2025, more than half of all solar panels the company estimates will be produced annually in the U.S.  But here's another big reason why American solar stocks like First Solar are soaring Solar tax credits.  While the Biden administration has not named solar yet as a manufacturing priority, it supports extending tax credits for solar panel purchases or to require federal contractors to purchase more solar panels from U.S. suppliers.  U.S. solar manufacturers are fully supporting the proposed tax credits, saying they could boost domestic production of solar panels while also creating tens of thousands of new jobs.  First Solar has backed the tariffs saying they are essential to fight low-priced goods from abroad. However, industry specialists say tax credits are not enough, and hefty subsidies via tax breaks would be needed in addition to the tariffs, to get the sector really going.  Widmar is skeptical whether even that will work China heavily subsidizes whatever strategic industry it chooses to focus on. How does any American company ever compete he has posed.  Also on the move is San Jose, California-based Sunpower Corp., with SPWR shares nearly 10% up over the past five trading days. SunPower manufactures crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and solar panels based on an all-back-contact solar cell technology.  SunPower really is an old head in the solar industry and has tried its hand at many aspects of the business. However, the company's latest act involves becoming a more specialized player in solar technology, after selling its microinverters business to Enphase in 2018 and completing the acquisition of Maxeon NASDAQMAXN in 2019.  A key benefit of this strategy has been a reduction in SunPower's cost of capital and a healthier balance sheet. It's too early to tell whether SunPower's streamlining efforts will pay off in the long run but if you love a good turnaround story, this company might be a good buy.  Losers Chinese Manufacturers  The ban by the Customs and Border Protection comes days after the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security banned four other firms located in Xinjiang to its entity listnbsp Xinjiang Daqo New Energy Co., Xinjiang East Hope Nonferrous Metals Co., Xinjiang GCL New Energy Materials Technology Co., and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps.nbsp  Related Solar Has An Unlikely New Enemy  All the four companies are involved in the manufacture or use of polysilicon products, with Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps having been the target of a previous import ban by the Trump administration.  Daqo New Energy Corp., another polysilicon maker with a factory in Xinjiang, has dipped 7% after the news. Daqo is a Chinese company that manufactures monocrystalline silicon and polysilicon solar PV systems.nbsp  Daqo's addition to the entity list has come despite the company recently going out of its way and hosting a visit to its main manufacturing facility in Xinjiang in an extraordinary effort at transparency.  And the ban will certainly not make life any easier for one of China's leading solar names, Jinko Solar.  One of the biggest trends that has been driving the phenomenal growth being witnessed in the renewable energy sector is fallingnbspcosts. And nowhere has this been more evident than the solar sector. Indeed, solar photovoltaics PV has seen the sharpest cost decline of any electricity technology over the last decade, with the International Renewable Energy Agency IRENA finding that between 2010-2019, the cost of solar PV globally dropped by 82%.  But that bullish thesis is now in grave danger.nbsp  A quadrupling in the cost of polysilicon has pushed solar module prices up 20% YTD and threatens to lay to waste years of gains.  Polysilicon makers have struggled to keep up with demand, lifting prices to as high as $25.88/kg, up from $6.19/kg less than a year ago.  Jinko's been in correction mode for most of the year due to the said supply chain issues. Since January, the shares have lost nearly 40%.  Overall, Biden's latest move is likely to be strongly bullish for U.S. solar equipment manufacturers over the long term.  Just months after president Biden rejoined the Paris Climate accord, global energy market navel-gazer IHS Markit has ranked the United States as the most attractive market for renewable energy investments in the world.  The United States has claimed the top spot on the latest IHS Markit Global Renewables Markets Attractiveness Rankings mainly on sound market fundamentals and the availability of an attractive--though phasing down--support scheme. The survey  tracks attractiveness for investment for non-hydro renewables such as solar PV, offshore wind, and onshore wind. The ranking evaluates each country on the basis of seven subcategories that include market fundamentals, current policy framework, infrastructure readiness, investor friendliness, revenue risks and return expectations, easiness to compete and the overall opportunity size for each market.

The EV Boom Is Coming Much Earlier Than Expected,2021-06-26T14:00:00-05:00,"The electric vehicle EV boom is now expected to come five years earlier than originally anticipated, in 2033, according to new research.  Based on new Ernst amp Young AI analysis for supply and demand, experts are suggesting that EV sales will surpass those of traditional vehicles by 2033, with Europe reaching this point in 2028, China by 2033, and the U.S. by 2036. The research suggests that non-EV sales could plummet to as low as 1 percent of total vehicle sales by 2045.nbsp  While Europe will be the first to achieve record EV sales, due to increasing vehicle demand China will likely lead the way through to 2050.nbsp  Pressure from governments across Europe and in China for companies to meet green policy expectations means increasing fees for car manufacturers buying and selling gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles. The goal of net-zero has spread around the globe, meaning many automakers are making the switch earlier than anticipated.nbspnbsp  President Trumprsquos withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, which was re-joined by the U.S. under President Biden in January, meant the easing of fuel regulations. While the U.S. will catch up with China and Europersquos EV market, this will likely happen at a slightly later date.nbsp  ldquoThe regulatory environment from the Biden administration we view as a big contributor because he has ambitious targets,rdquo EYrsquos global advanced manufacturing and mobility leader, Randy Miller, stated in an interview.  As several big car manufacturers jump on board the EV boom, we are seeing an increase in public interest in making the switch. The availability of reliable car brands now developing EV models is a shift from the Tesla-dominated market of previous years.nbsp  In addition, the millennial demographic that previously rejected car ownership for environmental reasons, as well as city living, has been influenced by the pandemic to move away from public transport and car-sharing. The potential for EV makers to tap into this environmentally-conscious market is significant.nbsp  Just as this research comes out, Volkswagen announces an expected record year for its EV sales. Relatively new to the market, VW sold almost half as many EVs as Tesla in 2020, a figure that is expected to rise substantially in 2021. WV sold 231,600 electric-powered vehicles in 2020, up from 73,600 the previous year.nbsp  Seeing the acceleration of the EV market, various cities and states around the world are now making the uptake of EVs easier through financial incentives, as governments encourage consumers to switch away from petroleum and diesel-powered cars.nbspnbsp  Related Can The Middle East Survive Without Oil  Just this week, major petroleum consumer India announced plans to subsidize EV purchases to encourage making the switch, putting the countryrsquos National Electric Mobility Plan into practice.

Will Iran Emerge As A Renewable Energy Breakout Story,2021-06-24T12:00:00-05:00,"Iran is without doubt one of the wealthiest countries in terms of energy production. Not only does the Middle Eastern country possess the worldrsquos 2nd largest natural gas reserves and 4th largest oil reserves, but its renewables potential is also truly remarkable. As Iran is facing an energy shortage of epic proportions, the government is tapping into its solar and wind potential instead of fossil fuels or nuclear energy. Although there is significant potential, most initiatives have yet to materialize.  Iranrsquos renewables capacity is already 12.92 GW according to IRENA. This is mostly hydropower from the countryrsquos extended network of dams in the mountainous and rainy north. Climate change and an extended period of drought, however, have reduced the flow of water into rivers, which has reduced the countryrsquos power production capacity by 50 percent. Hence, the government has been aiming for an additional source of electricity production.  Although Iran possesses some of the worldrsquos largest fossil fuel reserves, rampant air pollution in primarily urban areas has become a serious problem over the years. As numerous other issues regularly stir up the population, the Islamic regime has wisely decided that it doesnrsquot, proverbially, want to add oil to the fire. Therefore, expanding power production with fossil fuels is not a preferred option.  Tehran set itself the goal in its latest five-year plan to develop 5 GW of renewables by 2022. The countryrsquos energy sector hasnrsquot been able to develop most large-scale projects, falling short 80 percent of its goal. There have been successes though. Notably, the installation of small-scale rooftop solar by households and businesses has taken off supported by an established feed-in tariff regime that rewards local production in the sun-scorched country. Politics, however, are the primary culprit for Tehran's failure in its energy goals.    The expansion of the renewables sector is one of the few topics that virtually all Iranian politicians agree on, regardless of religious or political ideology. The recent election of Ebrahim Raisi won't derail the country's ambitions to become a green energy powerhouse. The next government will likely support the renewables sector in its next five-year plan. Especially as the tide could be changing in favor of Iranrsquos energy sector.  Although some projects have materialized, such as Merat International Groups 416 MW initiative in Fars province, Iranrsquos potential is much larger. The spoiler that derailed Tehranrsquos plan was Trumprsquos unilateral withdrawal of the JCPOA, or Iran nuclear deal, that was followed by reimposition of sanctions. Western companies quickly put their investment plans on hold in fear of being shut out from the U.S. market.  Unexpectedly to the intentions of the previous U.S. administration, Iranrsquos energy sector has had some successes. Due to the sanctions, Iranian companies were forced to develop their technology. The local industrial conglomerate Mapna, for example, has become a manufacturer of certain components. It remains to be seen what Tehran intends to do when potentially the sanctions are lifted allow competition or protect its market through tariffs and risk increasing economic costs.  Although the waxing and weaning of sanctions have scared western investors, not all international partners are absent from the Iranian market. Chinese companies are notorious for ignoring U.S. sanctions as Beijing is powerful and single-minded enough to thwart Washington. More recently, China and Iran signed an agreement that could change the balance of power in the Middle East.  After five years of negotiations, which started before Trump became president, Iran and China signed an agreement for strategy and economic partnership for the next 25 years and worth an estimated $400 billion. It includes investments in the renewables sector and energy infrastructure which could become a major boon for the Middle Eastern country.  Tehran, however, prefers a balanced economic relationship to prevent becoming over-reliant on China. Iran prefers to balance its relationship with the Chinese by doing business with the Europeans. Therefore, a lot depends on the ongoing negotiations in Vienna and the willingness of the U.S. to lift sanctions in exchange for Iran curbing its nuclear ambitions.  Regardless of the outcome, expect the Iranian government to pursue its ambitions in the renewables sector. The countryrsquos potential concerning both wind and solar is simply overwhelming to ignore.

Solar Has An Unlikely New Enemy,2021-06-23T15:00:00-05:00,"Wind and solar generation capacity topped new capacity additions in 2020 despite the pandemic, prompting praise from energy authorities and environmentalists, as well as urges for picking up the pace so wind and solarmdashespecially solarmdashcould become the dominant source of energy for the world sooner than 2030.  The narrative of the cheap solar panel is so common, few question it at all, especially when it features data about the declining cost curve of panels. According to this narrative, solar farm electricity is already cheaper than the electricity produced by gas-fired plants.What the narrative omits is that this is not universally true as of yet. The other thing the narrative omits, perhaps out of genuine lack of awareness, is that the cost curve for any product, be it a photovoltaic panel, a wind turbine, or a barrel of crude oil, depends on many factors. And some of these factors are not exactly favorable.  For all the benefits of solar powermdashcheap, emission-free energy from a virtually endless supply except during the night and when itrsquos overcast, raining, or snowingmdashthe technology has some drawbacks.

Now, one of the big problems of solarmdashthat is, land usemdashhas drawn the attention of a perhaps unlikely opponent environmentalists.  Utility-scale solar farm projects are increasingly drawing opposition from environmentalist groups, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month, citing the Battle Born Solar Project, which will covermdashliterallymdash14 square miles, or, as the WSJ puts it, 7,000 football fields. Thatrsquos a lot of land to cover with solar panels, which would render it useless for any other purpose.  Related Is OPEC Ready To Open The Taps  Opponents of the Battle Born Solar Project from the nearest community are not among renewable power skeptics that mock solar farms. They are, in fact, environmentally conscious people who are, however, concerned that the massive solar farm will spoil the land, upset ecosystems, and last but not least, make their beautiful views less beautiful.  Itrsquos a Beautiful Problemnbsp  It was really bound to happen. Anyone whorsquos had the chance of seeing a utility-scale solar farm knows they are not exactly works of art that one would enjoy seeing on a daily basis. The logic, as with so many other things, seems to be, ldquoItrsquos great, but I donrsquot want it in my backyard.rdquo And itrsquos not all about aesthetics, either. Build enough massive solar farms, and we might have a climate problem on our hands.  Solarrsquos En Fuego  Earlier this year, two researchers from Sweden and Australia challenged an idea that has been circulating in the public space for a while. They challenged the notion that building a few giant solar farms in the Sahara desert will solve the worldrsquos energy problems.nbsp  Not so, Zhengyao Lu from Swedenrsquos Lund University and Benjamin Smith from Western Sydney Universitynbspwarned. Solar farms have a heat problem, and the bigger the farm, the bigger the problem becomes.  Solar panels convert light into electricity at an average rate of 15 and 20 percent. So, 15-20 percent of the light solar panels absorb, they convert into electricity. The rest appears to be the problem, according to Lu and Smith.  The energy that solar panels cannot convert into electricity gets released back into the environment in the form of heat, the climate researchers explain. While their focus is on the Sahara, with its light-colored sand, the fact that solar panels release energy back as heat remains regardless of what the environment is.  Inconvenient Truth Costs are Rising  Besides emerging environmentalist opposition, however, the solar industry has a much more immediate problem costs are rising. Because of the global supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic, the cost of virtually all raw materials are soaring, reversing the steady trend of cost declines we have witnessed in solar panels for more than a decade. Besides evidence that nothing should be taken for granted, even solar panel prices, this fact threatens what many like to call a renewable energy revolution.  Related Reuters U.S. Agrees To Lift Iran Oil Sanctions  This is happening at the worst possible time for that revolution. The International Energy Agency, in its Net Zero by 2050 roadmap, said it will require adding 23,000 Twh of the total 71,000 TWh the world will need by 2050. But Norwegian Rystad Energy went further. The consultancy recently estimated that the world could add some 50,000 TWh because it is so cheap.    ldquoThe world needs to grow its power generation capacity further in order to fulfill electrification goals in buildings, transportation and industry and solar PV is the cheapest and most convenient way,rdquo Rystad analysts said.  This no longer appears to be the case. A recent Financial Times report noted that the shares of solar power companies have shed some 18 percent since the start of the year as the prices of steel, polysilicon, and transportation have all soared. The chief executive of the U.S. Solar Fund expects these higher raw material prices to boost new solar installation costs by as much as 20 percent. And the US Solar Industries Association warned this is only the beginning ldquocompounding cost increases across all materials are just beginning to affect installers,rdquo the association said.  Perhaps SampP Platts analyst Bruno Brunetti put it best, as quoted by the FT ldquoThe narrative in the solar industry has shifted,rdquo Brunetti said. ldquoWe have seen steep declines in costs over the past decade, but we are seeing that stabilise now and even increase in some cases.rdquoBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com",-1,0.9799,"['solar', ' ', 'energy', 'panels', 'Solar', 'narrative', 'cost', 'farm', 'electricity', 'problem', 'world']"
